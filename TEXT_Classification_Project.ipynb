As I stated, religion\\n\\nThere are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.\\nThe name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form \\'Armina\\'\\nor \\'Aramaniya\\' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.\\nThe following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun\\ncuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).\\n\\n 1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam \\'Armeniya\\'.\\n\\n 6. On reaching Arminam \\'Armeniya\\'.\\n\\n 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya \\'Armeniya\\'.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian:\\n\\nAs for \\'Armenia\\', the equivalent of the \\'Armin\\' or \\'Arminik\\' of the Persians,\\nthis is more recent than the word \\'Ararat\\', and is to be found used in\\nthe Dara inscriptions for \\'Haiastan\\'.  \\n\\nSaint Martin:\\n\\nThe name \\'Armenie\\' has been given since very early times by almost all\\nthe various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians\\nas \\'Haiastan\\'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs\\nas Ermeniyye.\\n \\nOthers believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as \\'Harminap\\'\\nwhich was later modified by the Persians to \\'Arminia\\'. \\'Ar\\' refers to a\\nplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, \\nwhile \\'men\\' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and \\ntherefore \\'Armen\\' would appear to signify \\'the people of that place\\'.\\n\\nG. Alishan believes that \\'according to our national vocabulary \"Haik\"\\nis the diminutive form of \"Hai\", and that \"Hai\" is the name of our\\nnation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word \"Armen\" that\\nforeigners apply to our people.\\'\\n\\nIt would thus appear that \\'Armenia\\' is a place-name, that \\'Armen\\' is \\nthe name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way\\nconnected with the word \\'Hai\\'.\\n\\nHaik and Haiastan:\\n\\nArmenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom\\nthe Armenian people took the name \\'Hai\\'. But the mere resemblance\\nbetween the words \\'Haik\\' and \\'Hai\\' constitutes no real proof, and,\\nin any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of\\nKhoren.\\n\\nHaiasa:\\n\\nThe following studies show quite clearly that \\'Hai\\' and \\'Haiasa\\' were\\nno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the \\nregion known as Armenia.\\n\\nProfessor Hachadurian: \\'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite\\ninscriptions for Upper Armenia.\\'\\n\\nYensen, in his \\'Hittites and Armenians\\' tries to prove that \\'Hai\\' is\\nidentical with the Hittite \\'Hatio\\', in other words that \\'Hai\\' is a\\nHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\\nthat \\'Hai\\' was derived from \\'Hatio\\'.\\n\\nMortman\\'s attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \\nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\\n\\nThe resemblance between the words \\'Haiasa\\' and \\'Haiastan\\' is so obvious\\nthat we may well accept \\'Haiasa\\' as the oldest form of \\'Haiastan\\'.\\n\\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words \\'Hai\\', \\'Haikazan\\' and\\n\\'Haiastan\\' entered our older works.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian: \\n\\n\\'The word \"Haik\" is never to be found employed with reference to a\\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\\never found employed in the forms \"Haika\" or \"Haykazn\".\\n\\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\\nto a nation and had been derived from \"Hai\" or \"Haik\" they could \\nalso have used the words \"Haikak\" and \"Haykazn\" in a number of\\nplaces.\\'\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \\ninscriptions:\\n\\n\\'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\\nor species. The words \"Haddanas\", \"Haddina\" were used by the \\nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\\n\"d\" between the two \"a\" letters to \"y\" \"Hadinasdani\" was in this\\nway transformed to \"Haiastan\"\\'.\\n\\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms \\'Hai\\'\\nand \\'Haistan\\' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \\nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name \\'Haiasa\\' \\nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\\nForrer takes \\'Haiasa\\' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\\nit seems likely that \\'Haiasa\\' was actually a part of Armenia. The\\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is \\'Hayasa\\', which\\nrefers to the country of the \\'Hayasas\\'.\\n\\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \\nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\\n\\nAccording to J. Deniker:\\n\\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \\ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race.

We ran into one of my relatives at the \\nbus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,\\nnear the store. Well at first we didn\\'t know what was happening, and then a\\nfellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \"What are you\\nstanding here for? Go home immediately!\" I asked, \"What\\'s going on?\" He says, \\n\"What\\'s the matter, can\\'t you see, they\\'ve overturned a car and they\\'re \\nkilling Armenians!\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.\\n\\nWe sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our \\ncourtyard. But the neighbors wouldn\\'t let them in the building. There were \\nabout 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They\\nwere shouting something, but you couldn\\'t understand it. It wasn\\'t one voice \\nor two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.\\nThey went up to the third _floor, and we see that they\\'re breaking glass and \\nthrowing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one \\nhas a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a \\nguitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.\\n\\nWe had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School \\nNo. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families \\nthere with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only \\nknown Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani \\nguard at the school let us in. At first he didn\\'t want to, but there was \\nnowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We \\nwere told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our \\nmicrodistrict.\\n\\nWe went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.\\n\\nOn the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be\\nused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of \\nthem and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I\\nasked him for assistance. I say, \"We\\'re in School No. 33, we need to be \\nevacuated.\" Well he says, \"Got it, wait there, I\\'m sending out help now.\"\\n\\nI know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with\\nhim personally. When I called he said, \"Muslimzade here.\"\\n\\nAbout two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out\\nthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \"Armenians, come \\nout, we\\'re here to get you.\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in \\ntheir hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \"Where should I go?\" I \\nsay, \"If your life is of any value to you you\\'ll go down there and say that \\nthe Armenians were here and that they left.\" That\\'s what he did. He went down \\nthere and said, \"The Armenians were here,\" he said, \"I let them out the back \\ndoor, they went that way.\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and \\nnoise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.\\n\\nSo the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!\\nInstead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that\\nMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that \\nwe were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the \\nmorning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.\\n\\nIn the morning we went to my relative\\'s in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers \\ntook us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there \\nwere lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, \\nabout three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn\\'t a single doctor, \\nnothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was\\njust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything\\nthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his \\nmother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...\\n\\nI searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I\\nwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third\\nfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, \\nwith their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of \\nthem.\\n\\nThere were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, \\neveryone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City\\nParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage \\nwas 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being\\nsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to \\nget the things any cheaper.\\n\\nI met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in\\nhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we \\nworked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw \\nme and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his \\nfeelings, of course.\\n\\n   April 8, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

It\\nBM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities\\n\\t\\t\\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nhenrik]\\tAgain, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do\\nhenrik]\\twant them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.\\n\\nNews reports I've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise.  \\nCAPS don't change facts.\\n\\nBM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,\\nBM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it\\nBM] is a part of it.  \\n\\nhenrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged \\nhenrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.\\n\\nSo?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about \\nDEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.\\n\\nhenrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 \\nhenrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the \\nhenrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending \\nhenrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. \\n\\nBM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them\\nBM]  within their borders?  \\n\\nhenrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into \\nhenrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.\\n\\nSo I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?\\n\\nhenrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the \\nhenrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER \\nhenrik] OCCUR again.\\n\\nBM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?\\n\\nhenrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped\\nhenrik] into Armenia if SHE could.\\n\\nWhy would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash\\nthat Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region,\\nlike economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd\\nbe happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET\\nrather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't \\ndo.  \\n\\nBM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header\\nBM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many\\nhenrik]\\t   cases, HISTORY repeats itself. \\n\\nEven if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would\\nbe to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been\\na democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the\\ntime, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no\\nwish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not\\nonly accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]\\n\\nBM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes \\nBM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring\\nBM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians \\nBM] are attacking Azeri towns.\\n\\nhenrik]\\t   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey\\nhenrik]\\t   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!\\n\\nSo what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?  \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   I will believe it when I see it.\\n\\nNo, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.\\n\\nhenrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing\\nhenrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?\\n\\t\\nThis kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.\\n\\nhenrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the\\nhenrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean\\nhenrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !\\n\\nNow, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff\\nperpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to\\nkeep the hatred alive, right?\\n\\nBM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the \\nBM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that \\nBM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's \\nBM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are \\nhenrik]\\t   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY \\nhenrik]\\t   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. \\n\\nWell they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods\\nof asking (not very peaceful I'd say).\\n\\nBM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent \\nBM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe \\nBM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better \\nBM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the\\nhenrik]\\t   conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in\\nhenrik]\\t   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.\\n\\nI don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans.\\nPeace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening\\nright now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights \\nraving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure\\nthere'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other\\nside.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace\\nthan they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't\\nstrong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the \\nbombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign \\nrelations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided\\natrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to \\nthe other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course,\\nthis being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.\\n\\n\\nBM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\\nBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of \\nBM] their blood and future. \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension\\nhenrik]\\t   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH\\nhenrik]\\t   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.\\n\\nAzeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support\\nwhat they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be\\nreached in this manner.  \\n\\nBM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \\nBM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\\nBM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \\nBM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\\nBM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for\\nBM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading\\nBM] inflammatory half-truths.\\n\\nhenrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative.

I came \\nhome from school at 12 o\\'clock, being excused to leave before the last period \\nin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was \\nthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and \\nother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first \\ncousin\\'s birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and \\non the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring \\nthat I\\'d have enough time to do my homework for the next day.\\n\\nWhen we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped \\nby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. \\nThe driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus\\nbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to \\nthe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking \\npassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not \\ntaken for Armenians.\\n\\nWe set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old \\nbuilding where we knew there\\'d be a place to hide, but the whole road was \\npacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th \\nMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people\\'s pockets and checking\\npassports. People who didn\\'t have passports with them were beaten as well.\\nThen we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning\\ncars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \"Death to\\nthe Armenians\" was written on the cars.\\n\\nWhen we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still\\nquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn\\'t turn on any lights. We tried to call \\nBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. \\nThen there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to \\ncome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us\\nto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you \\nenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was \\nbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors\\' daughter said that that\\'s right, \\nthat\\'s what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people \\nwere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn\\'t stay very \\nlong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, \\nlooking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said \\nthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a\\ncar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that \\nthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that \\nthere weren\\'t any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \\nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \\nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\\nAvakian was killed, too.\\n\\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \\nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn\\'t turn on the light. We \\nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\\ndecided she had already left.\\n\\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father\\'s\\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn\\'t want to give him our address,\\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\\n\\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \\nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \\ncould do. One of them took my parents\\' passports and began to read them. He \\nread the surname \"Danielian,\" turned the page, read \"Armenian,\" and that alone\\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \\ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \\npushed some of the keys on the piano and said \"your death has tolled.\" They \\nhad knives and steel truncheons.\\n\\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t use it. I just knew that if\\nI didn\\'t give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \\nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \\noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\\npush her so she\\'d walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \\nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \\nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\\n\\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \\nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \\nstrike me, and I\\'m knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \\nlose consciousness often . . . I don\\'t see or hear my parents, since I was the\\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \\ntheir balconies. That\\'s it. I try to pick them up, but can\\'t. My left arm is \\nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \\nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\\n\\nWe were attacked at around 9 o\\'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \\ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors\\' door, \\nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \\nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \\nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can\\'t see very far as a \\nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \\naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \\naway, and everything will be OK.\\n\\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \\no\\'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \\nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \\nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o\\'clock I and the other Armenians who are \\nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\\n\\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\\nbefore the 27th.\\n\\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \\nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \\nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \\nthat they were dead. My father\\'s older brother told me.\\n\\nMy father\\'s name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \\nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \\nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\\n\\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner\\'s report stated that their\\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\\n\\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \\nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \\nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \\nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn\\'t know the address.\\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \\nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \\ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \\nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \\ncalled from home, which also isn\\'t true. I heard noise and the sounds of \\nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \\nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \\nyears old. I don\\'t know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \\nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\\n\\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \\ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \\nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \\nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town\\'s construction. Mamma was from \\nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \\na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\\n\\n\\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \\nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\\n\\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \\nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\\n\\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\\n\\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\\n\\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \\nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \\nArmenia.\\n\\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\\ncan do that.\\n\\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \\nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\\n\\nYou can\\'t take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \\neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \\nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \\nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \\na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \\nin the hands of our government.\\n\\nJune 13,1988\\n\\nStepanakert \\n\\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\\nS.D.P.A.

My point is that it will inevitably turn out that way, and we can save\\nourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their\\nproblems on their own. Colonial interventions, even in Haiti, haven't worked \\nin the past. They had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. The US invaded in 1915. And left\\nin 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to.

In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much\\ngreater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far\\nbetter reasons to take action than the US.\\n\\n>The whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country, and we were more\\n>willing to send troops there than to Bosnia--exactly the _opposite_ of what\\n>the \"fixation on European countries\" theory would predict.  (Similarly, the\\n>desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite\\n>of what that theory predicts.)\\n\\nYou continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to\\nintervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this\\nword, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as\\nracist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I\\nsaid the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result\\nof it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and\\n3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side\\nwould be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the\\nconflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite\\nthe fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was\\nconsiderably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news\\nI see are any guide.\\n\\n\\nDave\\n\\n'),\n",

On a couple of occasions on\\nthose shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he\\nmade the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in\\ndispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled\\nand occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying\\nthat since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and\\nlost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to\\nreconquer them today.\\n\\nI was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew\\nwho escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found\\nsympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent\\nmonths when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my\\nfather would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi\\nand pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is\\nso pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My\\nfather also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis,\\nbecause, my father said, Anthony Lewis \"is always talking about\\nthe Muslims.\"\\n\\nUpdate--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around\\nSbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and\\nthe killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton\\nadministration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the\\ncollapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune.\\nPreviously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds\\nthat it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces\\nbegan to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers\\nwent unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention\\nto stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  The\\ncurrent disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West\\nand a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to\\nhalt the Serbs. Now that it\\'s too late to save Muslim areas that\\nLord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly\\ncalls for strong action.\\n\\nCLINTON AND BOSNIA\\n\\nIn the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department\\nofficial, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made\\nnews when he resigned from the State Department because of the\\nBush administration\\'s refusal to take any action to halt Serbian\\naggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush\\'s inaction was largely due to\\nthe president\\'s unwillingness to risk any political capital by\\ngetting involved there.\\n\\nApparently the same is true of the Clinton administration.\\nClinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did\\nabout the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has\\nso far been the same.\\n\\nAccording to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton\\nadministration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March\\nreport by its own experts which called for military action if\\nnecessary to protect \"safe havens\" for the Muslims. At one point,\\nSenate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the\\nreport was kept from Congress, that he called for an\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nInstead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled\\nagain and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what\\nthey want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been\\nsignalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish\\noff the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other\\nway.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would\\nNOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this\\nissue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could\\nnot have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better\\nwell before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and\\nthe destruction might have been curtailed..\\n\\nThe Nation, the left and \"the Bosnian QUANDARY\"\\n\\nTypical of the left\\'s inability to come to grips with the core\\nissue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying\\nhundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the \"Bosnian\\nquandary\" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes\\nto do nothing, even while noticing \"the ghastly atrocities of the\\nBosnian Serbs\"  and that the \"greater and lesser powers...dither\\nand fuss [and] hang back.\" (\"Before anything else happens, the\\nClinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United\\nStates owes the\" U.N. the editorial concludes.)\\n\\nIn its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that\\n\"those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side\\nof the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World\\nWar II.\"  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the\\nBosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients\\nincluding the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and\\nothers. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher\\nHitchens correctly called this editorial, \"contemptible.\")\\n\\n***\\n\\nWilliam Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The\\nNew Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal\\ncolumnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly\\nand consistently called for strong Western and American\\nintervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff\\'s most recent column\\n(Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled \"International\\nCowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy.\"\\n\\nHe clarifies the international failure which has led to present\\nsituation in one sentence. \"Having refused to intervene to\\nsanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent\\nCroatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military\\naggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious\\n\"ethnic cleansing\" which followed that, the United Nations now\\ncontemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which\\ntwo years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since\\nexperienced.\"  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged\\ncall for a \"more daunting and open-ended military assignment than\\na direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have\\nbeen a year ago.\"\\n\\nAryeh Neier on the Serbs In his \"Watching Rights\" column in the\\nThe Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the\\nmotivation of the \"aggressors\"--the preferred term for the Serbian\\nforces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than\\na year.  He explains that \"there is no  military purpose that is\\nserved by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above\\nall, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would\\nwant to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are\\nnot city people.\\n\\n\"It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of\\nBosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at\\nany price--that explains the conduct of the siege of\\nSarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and\\ncosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation.\\n\\n\"Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and\\nHerzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil\\nservants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule,\\nmade up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The\\ndestruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility\\nagainst this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The\\ndemagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war\\nexploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred\\nfor all that is cosmopolitan.\"\\n\\nThe light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is\\nat stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist,\\nfundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban,\\ncosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking\\nthe rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the\\nbeginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained\\nby the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a\\nthreat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state.\\n\\nNeier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to\\nsecularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It\\'s the\\nSerbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic\\nidea.\\n\\nAnthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does\\nrespect for Clinton\\'s presidency \"depend...on his acting\\neffectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to\\ndo nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values\\nwe and our allies profess.\"  (Times, 4/26/93) But it\\'s not merely\\na betrayal of our values.  It\\'s because the Serbs are attacking us\\nby proxy, just as Hitler was.\\n\\nOne argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a\\ndifferent form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for\\nEurope.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe\\'s Palestinians;\\nthat is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been\\nthe key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the\\nhundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities\\nresult in turmoil in Europe for decades to come.\\n\\nOne of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though\\nthe Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to\\nthe destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will\\ninevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a\\nwhirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.\\nAnd as past history and Pfaff have shown, it\\'s much better if we\\ndo so decisively, quickly and on our terms.\\n\\nSincerely, Ronald Bleier\\n\\n'),\n",

Azeri views on this dispute have\\n[AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me\\n[AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the\\n[AR] origins of the conflict.\\n\\nDuring the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,\\na small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.\\n\\nThe following should be interesting. \\n\\n[AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and\\n[AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,\\n[AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian\\n[AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,\\n[AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,\\n[AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait\\n[AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThis not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an\\nindependent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September\\n1991, page 28, we read:\\n\\n \"By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in\\n  Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party\\n  for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to\\n  reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were\\n  deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000 \\n  Armenian inhabitants fled the city...\"\\n\\n  Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in\\n  Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.\"\\n\\nIn this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian \\npogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!\\n\\n[AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that\\n[AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule\\n[AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of \"divide and\\n[AR] rule.\"  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year\\n[AR] history of the conflict.\\n\\nIt is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the\\nperpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.\\n \\n[AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in\\n[AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an\\n[AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in\\n[AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian\\n[AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.\\n\\nIncorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an\\nagreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-\\nKarabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.\\n \\n[AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri\\n[AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and\\n[AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the\\n[AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly\\n[AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly\\n[AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.\\n \\nIt\\'s called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn\\'t try to deport and allow the \\nArmenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian\\nculture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The\\nAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and\\nplay dead. \\n\\n[AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country\\n[AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the\\n[AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish\\n[AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government\\n[AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and\\n[AR] possessions?\\n\\nThe Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they\\nattempted to deprive Armenians of \"lands, homes, and possessions\".\\n \\n[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.\\n[AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian\\n[AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,\\n[AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.\\n\\nTrue, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!\\n \\n[AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.\\n[AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western\\n[AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security\\n[AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led\\n[AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed\\n[AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the\\n[AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.\\n[AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.\\n\\nWestern interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into\\nthis conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of \\nEurope (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!\\nDr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would\\nhave us believe.\\n \\n[AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an\\n[AR]\"Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.\"  The truth is that the Armenians\\n[AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.\\n\\nIncorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish\\nclaim. \\n\\nArmenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as \"Artsakh\", which \\ncomes from the Urartian term \"Urtekhe-Urtekhini\". NO Azeris yet! \\n\\nAncient Greeks referred to Artsakh as \"Orkhistena\". NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nIn the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid\\nArmenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nFrom the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom\\nof Ervan. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nArtsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or \\nArtsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nAfter Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387 \\nA.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nEnd of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the \\nAranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nBy the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nEmperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen \"To\\nArmenia\". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!\\n\\nIn the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area\\nwas stated as 11,000.\\n\\nIt was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central\\nAsia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence\\nin the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!\\n\\nIn 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some \\nMuslims in Karabakh!\\n\\nIn 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188\\npriests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian\\npercentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --\\nassuming no Kurds!\\n\\nConsider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:\\n\\n \"The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the\\n  proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings\\n  to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between\\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and\\n  Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis\\n  Republic.\\n\\n  Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet\\n  Armenia and Azerbaidzan!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tN. Narimanov\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPeople\\'s Commissar for Foreign Affairs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGuseinov\"\\n\\n[AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their\\n[AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian\\n[AR] rule. \\n\\nNo, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule\\nin the Caucasus, including Karabakh!\\n\\n[AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew\\n[AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How\\n[AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in\\n[AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and\\n[AR] demanded separation from California?\\n\\nNon-sequitur. \\n \\n[AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement\\n[AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.\\n\\nArmenian historians don\\'t say this!\\n\\n[AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the\\n[AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and\\n[AR] nothing in common with Armenians.\\n\\nConsidering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and\\ntheir utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an \\nargument totally invalid!\\n\\n[AR] Azeris would have a better claim to\\n[AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,\\n[AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.\\n\\nWishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-\\npolitical advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,\\nAzeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their\\nminorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other\\nnationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.\\n\\n[AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the\\n[AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the\\n[AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual\\n[AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This\\n[AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the\\n[AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory\\n[AR] nations, not just by Turkey.\\n\\nSuch agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of\\nArmenians.\\n \\n[AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the\\n[AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.

Diplomats and aid\\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\\n\\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\\nAzerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\\ndead.\\n\\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\\n\\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\\nand products to wash the dead.\"\\n\\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will\\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\\nlawyer said at his small office.\\n\\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\\nFebruary.\\n\\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\\npilot.\\n\\n\"People waved up  to us for help.

As it turns \\nout, the main objective guiding the prime minister in the \\nsetting up of a Palestinian police force - and apparently \\nalso supported by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres - is to \\nensure the holding of democratic elections in the \\nterritories.\"\\n\\nThus writes Amnon Barzilai in his editorial (Israeli daily \\nHadashot, 23 April), and his position articulates the \\nthinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this \\nissue in the past two weeks. Over against them stand the \\nsettlers and rightwing parties, who also interpret the \\ndecision to encourage the establishment of a Palestinian \\npolice force as a significant step towards the instituting of \\nreal autonomy, something which will restrict what can be \\ndone by the Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza \\nStrip. With a variety of demonstrations, including street \\ntheater on \\'What will happen when there is a Palestinian \\npolice force\\', rightwing elements are attempting to \\nfrighten the Israeli public and to pressure Rabin to go \\nback on his decision. Members of the Kach movement \\nhave even begun to organize a \\'settler police force\\' in the \\nOccupied Territories, as counter-balance to the future \\nPalestinian police force.\\n\\nHowever, as Barzilai points out, the main function of the \\nnew police force - as far as the Israeli government is \\nconcerned - has nothing to do with the settlers, over \\nwhom they will apparently have no authority, but will \\ncontrol political groups within the Palestinian population, \\nwhom the government is interested in neutralizing. \\nWrites Barzilai:\\n\\n\"...According to ideas currently taking shape, the setting \\nup of a local police force in the territories will precede, \\nnot only the stage of electsion, but also the final stages of \\nthe preparing of the interim autonomy agreement.\\n\\n\"The willingness of the Israeli government to set up a \\nlocal Palestinian police force is evidence that the \\ngovernment is serious about arriving at a settlement with \\nthe Palestinians...\"\\n\\nIt\\'s no wonder that the Palestinian public is also greatly \\nworried about this new Israeli initiative. And it is \\ninevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on Faisal \\nHusseini and the rest of the delegation members, from a \\nvariety of directions, to refuse the gift which Rabin would \\nlike to give them. But at this stage, it looks like the \\nPalestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his \\nplans.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------\\nAdd\\'l comment by E.D.:\\nNumerous Palestinians fear that Israel might succeed in \\nco-opting some Palestinian\\ncircles by this idea. They fear that a Palestinian police \\nforce, controlled in fact by Israel, might act even more \\nbrutally than the IDF. The idea of using a surrogate police \\nforce is not new. It is used by Israel in Lebanon and was \\nused by the Nazis to control Jewish ghetto-dwellers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Another is to say that \"Only those\\n>who meet the religious definition of a Jew is one.\"  And there are\\n>others.  I\\'m not twisting your words.  I\\'m trying to make you aware that\\n>your words don\\'t mean what you think they do.\\n\\nI had never heard the definition: Only those who are religious are defined as Jews.\\nI had always seen the definition: A person is a Jew is his/her mother is/was\\na Jew, and if such person does not convert, although I had seen people\\nargue about the last part.\\n\\n>>\\n>>I am not talking about the debate.

These arrangements certainly seem to \\nbe essentially a rejection of any Palestinian \"interim\" self-control. \\nWithout exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible \\nvulnerability, can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the \\nnegotiating process) more \"relaxed\" proposals for this\"interim\" period? \\nHow should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their \\n\"maximalist\" approaches as stated above?

This report\\n  covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated\\n  November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.\\n\\n       1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian\\n  Transactions Regulations (\"ITRs\"), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the\\n  Iranian Assets Control Regulations (\"IACRs\"), 31 CFR Part 535,\\n  since the last report.\\n\\n       2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"FAC\") of the\\n  Department of the Treasury continues to process applications\\n  for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously\\n  reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a\\n  substantial decrease in the number of applications received\\n  relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.\\n\\n       During the reporting period, the Customs Service has\\n  continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin\\n  merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import\\n  prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-\\n  gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions\\n  and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional\\n  forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.\\n\\n       3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the\\n  \"Tribunal\"), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers\\n  Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims\\n  before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered\\n  12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have\\n  been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were\\n  awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of\\n  settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions\\n  adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions\\n  dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing\\n  claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,\\n  3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of\\n  Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful\\n  American claimants from the Security Account held by the\\n  NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.\\n\\n       As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen\\n  below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has\\n  periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers\\n  Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by\\n  the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account\\n  is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the\\n  proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the\\n  United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-\\n  case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the\\n  account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.\\n  The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest\\n  Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of\\n  March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was\\n  $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account\\n  was $8,638,133.15.\\n\\n       4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the\\n  arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.\\n  Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.\\n  More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been\\n  disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary\\n  withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger\\n  claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their\\n  complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable\\n  awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were\\n  awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October\\n  1992.\\n\\n       5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling\\n  the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the\\n  Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (\"FCSC\") has continued its\\n  review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in\\n  1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The\\n  FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining\\n  claims in early 1994.\\n\\n       6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,\\n  the Department of State continues to present United States\\n  Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the\\n  United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.\\n  In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of\\n  supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran\\'s claim\\n  against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign\\n  Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United\\n  States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in\\n several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also\\n  filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure\\n  of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation\\n  violated the Algiers Accords.\\n\\n       7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of\\n  the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No\\n  successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda\\'s resignation will\\n  take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up\\n  his duties.\\n\\n       8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve\\n  important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the\\n  United States and its nationals.  Iran\\'s policy behavior\\n  presents challenges to the national security and foreign\\n  policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to\\n  Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role\\n  in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling\\n  the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.\\n  Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613\\n  continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-\\n  national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal\\n  to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the\\n  Congress on significant developments.\\n\\n\\n                         WILLIAM J.

Generally, these\\ntelegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,\\nfor example, we have the following set regarding children:\\n\\n\\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\\n\\n\\t November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to\\n\\t the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum\\n\\t [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem\\n\\t families and received as servants when they are left alone through\\n\\t the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect\\n\\t all such children in your province and send them to the places of\\n\\t deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to\\n\\t the people.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMinister of the Interior,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTalaat\" [1]\\n\\n\\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\\n\\n\\t September 21, 1915.

Whether this is\\n\\t done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt\\n\\t of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or\\n\\t any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it\\n\\t purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as\\n\\t detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received\\n\\t into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish\\n\\t special orphanages for them.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMinister of the Interior,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTalaat.\" [4]\\n\\n\\t\"To the Government of Aleppo.\\n\\n\\n\\t Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures\\n\\t to which their parents have been subjected.

It is necessary that these children should be turned\\n\\t out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of\\n\\t deportation.

I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I\\n\\t shall die for it.\" [7]\\n\\n\\nThese telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of\\nTalaat Pasha\\'s, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never\\nquestioned these \"death march orders\" until 1986, during a time when the world\\nwas again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.\\n\\nFor reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the\\nTurkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were\\never issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a\\nstudy by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.\\n\\nIf one were to examine the sample \"authentic text\" provided in the Turkish \\nHistorical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it \\ntoo would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the \\nTurkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or \\nPersian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is\\na forgery. \\n\\nToday, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,\\nTurkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide \\narchitect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a \\nheightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a\\nfocal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.\\n\\nThis monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government\\'s pathological\\ndenial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only\\ncrime was to be born Armenian.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - references - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60\\n\\n[2] ibid, page 60\\n\\n[3] ibid, page 60\\n\\n[4] ibid, page 61\\n\\n[5] ibid, page 61\\n\\n[6] ibid, page 62\\n\\n[7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and\\n    London), 1926, page 387\\n\\n\\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\\nS.D.P.A.

Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \\nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \\nmathematics and didn\\'t mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn\\'t \\nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \\nno exception. Here\\'s what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \\nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \\nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \\nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \\nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it\\'s a fact that is \\nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \\nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \\nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \\nteachers.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \\nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \\nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \\nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \\nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\\nVenus and back.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tOne for the \"road\"\\n\\n\\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \\n\\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer\\'s book and saw a bright cover with \\n\\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \\n\\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\\n\\n\\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley\\'s book and saw the History \\n\\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he\\'ll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \\n\\tthe Royal Astronomer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\\n\\nThe book I\\'m talking about isn\\'t very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \\nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \\nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \\narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \\nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \\nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \\nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\\n\\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \\nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \\nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\\n\\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \\nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \\nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \\nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \\nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn\\'t let just\\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \\nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \\nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \\ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \\nproblem book.\\n\\n\\t\\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\\n\\n\\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \\n\\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \\n\\tit the mother of all wisdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Anania of Shirak\\n\\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \\nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \\nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \\nMovses of Khoren).\\n\\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\\n\\n\\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\\n\\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \\n\\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \\n\\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\\n\\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \\n\\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \\n\\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \\n\\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \\n\\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\\n\\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\\n\\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \\n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \\n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\\n\\n\\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \\n\\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \\n\\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \\n\\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \\n\\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \\n\\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \\n\\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\\n\\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \\n\\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \\n\\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\\n\\n\\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \\n\\thad come. He received me graciously and said: \"I praise Our Lord that \\n\\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \\n\\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \\n\\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \\n\\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \\n\\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \\n\\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\\n\\tat the king\\'s court began to envy me.\\n\\n\\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \\n\\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \\n\\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \\n\\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \\n\\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \\n\\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\\n\\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \\n\\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \\n\\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \\n\\toriginally.\\n\\n\\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \\n\\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \\n\\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \\n\\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \\n\\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \\n\\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \\n\\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \\n\\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \\n\\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \\n\\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \\n\\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \\n\\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \\n\\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \\n\\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\\n\\n\\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \\n\\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \\n\\tassume the teacher\\'s position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \\n\\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\\n\\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \\n\\twith him.\\n\\n\\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \\n\\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \\n\\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God\\'s \\n\\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \\n\\tfor my efforts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProblems and Solutions\\n\\n\\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\\n\\ton verge\\'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \\n\\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \\n\\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \\n\\tcopies were printed in all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\\n\\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\\nmanuscripts of Anania\\'s book were preserved only because, according to \\nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \\nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one\\'s own children.\" Biding\\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \\nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \\nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \\nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \\nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \\nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\\n\\nIn the translator\\'s words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \\nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \\ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \\nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \\nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \\ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \\nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \\nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\\n\\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \\nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \\nfull glory. So let\\'s open Anania\\'s problem book--a gift from across the ages.\\n\\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \\n572.\\n\\nProblem 1\\n\\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \\nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \\nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \\nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \\npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \\ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \\nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \\nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\\n\\nProblem 8\\n\\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \\nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \\nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \\na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\\n\\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \\ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \\naccording to Orbeli\\'s note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \\ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \\nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \\nAnania\\'s Problems and Solutions.\\n\\nProblem 18\\n\\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \\nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \\ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\\n\\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \\nAnania\\'s time -- for instance, problem 7.\\n\\nProblem 7\\n\\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \\nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \\nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \\nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\\n\\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I\\'ll restrain myself\\nand offer you just one more.\\n\\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \\ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \\nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \\nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\\n\\nProblem 20\\n\\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \\nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \\nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \\nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \\narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \\ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \\nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\\n\\n\\t\\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\\n\\n\\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \\n\\tbibliography.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\\n\\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \\nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \\nof Anania of Shirak\\'s Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \\nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \\nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \\na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \\nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \\nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \\nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \\nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \\nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \\nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\\n\\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \\norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \\nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \\nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \\nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \\nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \\nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \\nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \\nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \\nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\\n\\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \\nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \\nprinter\\'s craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \\nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\\nof Russian academic typography.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tBack to Earth\\n\\n\\tThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \\n\\tworks in this domain.

Even if\\n  the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the\\n  fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which\\n  Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the\\n  Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the\\n  realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution\\n  in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews\\n  fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that\\n  the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that\\n  there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and\\n  eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the\\n  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and\\n  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection\\n  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,\\n  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>\\n\\n\\n  page 21:\\n\\n  <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official\\n  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi\\n  Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and\\n  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation\\n  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from\\n  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two\\n  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom\\n  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European\\n  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.\\n  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant\\n  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of\\n  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who\\n  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)\\n\\n\\n  page 41:\\n\\n <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were\\n firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them\\n and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians\\n of Europe.\\n\\n Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is\\n also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews\\n as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.\\n Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians\\n representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European\\n sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition\\n it appears that Christian pirates plundered \\'\\'Turks and Jews,\\'\\'  their\\n sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who\\n regularly reported to the Ottomans.\\n\\n There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans\\n in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances\\n of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited\\n instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the\\n early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy\\n for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman\\n document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some\\n Greek towns...>>\\n\\n page 43:\\n\\n  <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally\\n accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,\\n and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of\\n the situation.>>\\n\\n\\n page 46:\\n\\n <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not\\n particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common\\n interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition\\n which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If\\n there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between\\n religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was\\n that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with\\n the Orthodox.>>\\n\\n page 46:\\n\\n <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context\\n during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of\\n interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed\\n Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already\\n existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish\\n response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian\\n countries to Ottoman domains.>>\\n\\n page 151:\\n\\n  <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the\\n  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would\\n  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,\\n  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and\\n  the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions\\n  elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the\\n  Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>\\n\\n  page 161:\\n\\n  <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success\\n  of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success\\n  in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both\\n  cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough\\n  to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success\\n  without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve\\n  the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear\\n  that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable\\n  partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.\\n  We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their\\n  success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the\\n  Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\\n  the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>\\n\\n\\n(*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati\\'s [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:\\n\\n  page 32:\\n\\n  <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles\\n  and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear\\n  the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly\\n  oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and\\n  prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob\\n  and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They\\n  wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will\\n  give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German\\n  rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,\\n  which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest\\n  and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you\\n  who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with\\n  in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out\\n  to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain\\n  of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are\\n  not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.\\n  Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us\\n  lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow\\n  hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and\\n  great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy\\n  among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him\\n  to rob him of his gold.

Deir Yassin was an unprovoked attack on\\nthe part of the Jews, and a massacre defines it best in my\\nopinion.

Deir Yassin was later\\nadvertized by the very Jews who perpetrated it because it was\\nuseful in getting many Palestinians to leave.  The Palestinians\\nwere rightfully scared off, because they did not want another\\nDeir Yassin.  \\n\\tI\\'m not necessarily condemning the Israelites here;\\natrocities were aslo committed on the part of the Arabs.\\nIsraelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are\\nand were the good guys in the middle east.

This was appraently attempted in the\\ncase of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason\\nto believe it still goes on.\\n\\nRead this:\\n\\nFrom Ma\\'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992\\n\\nPUBLICATION BAN\\n\\n        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many\\n        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were\\n        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of\\n        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever\\n        being made public.\\n\\nBy Baruch Me\\'iri\\n\\nAll those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way\\nor another: \"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I\\nwill be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific\\ncase, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something\\nwhich may legally not be published\".\\n\\nThe State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years\\nthere have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to\\nlong prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the\\ncrimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More\\nprecisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of\\ntheir arrest, and later on their imprisonment.\\n\\nIn Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of\\nthis country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about\\nthe fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,\\nfor security offenses, in complete secrecy.\\n\\nIn the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]\\naffair -- we heard about \"the third man\" being in prison.  But many\\nyears have passed since then, and what existed then can today no\\nlonger be found even in South American countries, or in the former\\nCommunist countries.\\n\\nBut it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.\\n\\nThe Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and\\nJustice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this\\nweek to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet\\nLegal Advisor.  Ma\\'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:\\n\\n\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been\\nimprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of\\nthese cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the\\nspecifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but\\neven on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after\\nbeing legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison\\nwithout public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the\\nprisoner\", asserts MK Zucker.\\n\\nOn the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \"There is\\nabsolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is\\nimperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of\\nsecurity offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases\\nthe Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances\\nunder which a trial will not be held in public.\\n\\n\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on\\nthe mere fact of a person\\'s arrest, and on the name of a person\\nsentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of\\nIsrael.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to\\nknow are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public\\nsight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\"\\n\\nZucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of\\nJustice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider\\nthe question.  \"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the\\ncost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The\\nState of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention\\nand its cause is kept secret\", wrote Zucker.\\n\\nThe legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai\\nShiffman said that, \"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any\\ncases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,\\nand whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation\\nwhich, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like\\ncensorship is an unhealthy matter\".\\n\\n\"The Union is aware\", says Shiffman, \"of cases where notification of a\\nsuspect\\'s arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am\\nspeaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee\\nwas not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole\\nfirst month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.\\n\\n\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --\\ncan challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where\\nthe family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The\\njournalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is\\nhappy...\"\\n\\nAttorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the\\nlaws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a\\nperson for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. \\n\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that\\'s\\nthat.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long\\nyears in prison without us knowing anything about it.\"\\n\\n-- Do you find this situation acceptable?\\n\\nAttorney Arnon: \"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and\\nsuch a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that\\npublication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but\\ntotal non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of\\nMordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged\\nwith aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The\\ntrial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for\\nthose who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,\\nthough not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least\\nare aware of his imprisonment.\"\\n\\n-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can\\'t we trust the\\ndiscretion of the court?\\n\\nAttorney Arnon: \"The judges have no choice but to trust the\\npresentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to\\ninvestigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which\\nthey can misuse.\"\\n\\n-- And what if there really is a security issue?\\n\\nAttorney Arnon: \"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.\\n Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible\\nto publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without\\nentering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning\\npublication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller\\nmurder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the\\nmatter being made public.\"\\n\\nAttorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can\\nbe a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect\\'s\\narrest, or of a convicted criminal\\'s imprisonment.  \"A healthy\\nsituation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere\\npublication may be harmful to state security\".\\n\\nA different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former\\nadvisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda\\nMeir.  \"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such\\nsituations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must\\nbe held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom\\nof expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom\\nwhich is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.\\n\\n\"Nevertheless\", adds Shtendal, \"the legislator allowed for the\\npossibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the\\ndamage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that\\nwhich may follow from an abridgment of the principles I\\'ve mentioned.\\nThe authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with\\nthe Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which\\nwe may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has\\nbeen convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\"\\n\\nNevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \"As a rule, clearly such a\\nphenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in\\nthe most extreme circumstances.\"\\n--\\nYigal Arens\\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\\narens@isi.edu\\n'),\n",

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-\\nger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the \\nphysical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \\nan awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\\nornaments, howling and howling. I didn\\'t know where I was or how long this \\nwent on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \\nwas in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\\ntears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\\n\\nThen someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \\nwant to respond and restrain myself, I think that I\\'m hallucinating. I am \\nsilent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man\\'s voice is calling\\nme, then a woman\\'s. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\\none whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \\ntelling him, \"I know that they\\'ve killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \\nher corpse to me so they don\\'t violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty\\nhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn\\'t want to carry the corpse into his \\napartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \\nwalking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn\\'t answer their calls. \\nThere was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\\n\\nThey started the pogrom in our apartment around five o\\'clock, and at 9:30 I \\nwent down to the Kasumovs\\'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\\napartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \\ncowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \\ndoors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \\nopened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \\nSabir\\'s son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don\\'t cry, Lyuda\\'s alive!\" He \\nknocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \\nAunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir\\'s wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \\napartment. I didn\\'t see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\\ndelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\\nAll of my family had gathered there.\\n   \\nAt the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\\napartment.\\n\\nLater I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \"Lyuda, \\nKarina\\'s in really serious condition, she\\'s probably dying. If she recognizes \\nyou, don\\'t cry, don\\'t tell her that her face looks so awful.\" It was as though\\nher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \\nside, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \\ncheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\\nmicrodistrict, that\\'s how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \\nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \\nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \\nthat was intact, looked at me, and said, \"Who is it?\" But I could barely talk, \\nmy whole face was so badly beaten. I didn\\'t say, but rather muttered something\\ntender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \"My Karochka, my Karina, my \\nlittle golden one . . . \" She understood me.\\n\\nThen Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina\\'s lips. \\nShe started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn\\'t \\nunderstand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \\nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \\nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don\\'t know how \\nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She\\'s\\nsaying something to me, but I can\\'t understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \\nand paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \\ncan\\'t write. I can\\'t understand what she\\'s saying. She wanted to tell me \\nsomething, but she couldn\\'t. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\\nthen maybe you\\'ll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\\n\"Maybe it\\'ll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn\\'t\\ncontrol myself.\\n\\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \\nsays, \"Lyuda, we\\'re not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \\ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They\\'ll find us here, too. We need\\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \\nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What\\'s his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \\nthat\\'s the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \\nBut I didn\\'t know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what\\'s his number?\" She \\nsays, \"I can\\'t remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \\nsays, \"I don\\'t know anything, leave me alone.\"\\n\\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \\ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \\nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \\nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn\\'t \\nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \\nfound out the number and called us back. The boss\\'s wife answered and said he \\nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can\\'t talk normally. She says, \\n\"Lyuda, don\\'t panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \\ntell them that they just can\\'t do that.\" She still didn\\'t know what was really\\ngoing on. I said, \"It\\'s easy for you to say that, you don\\'t understand what\\'s \\nhappening. They are killing people here. I don\\'t think there is a single \\nArmenian left in the building, they\\'ve cut them all up. I\\'m even surprised \\nthat we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it\\'s that serious \\n. . . \" And all the same she\\'s thinking that my emotions are all churned up \\nand that I\\'m fearing for my life, that in fact it\\'s not all that bad. \"OK, \\nfine, fine,\" she says, \"if you\\'re afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \\nI\\'ll send him over.\"\\n\\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \\nunder Aunt Tanya\\'s, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian\\'s apartment. She \\nwasn\\'t home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \\neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan\\'s wife is named Tanya too and \\nfinally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he\\'s come home, he\\'s leaving for your \\nplace now.\" He came. Of course he didn\\'t know what was happening, either, \\nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \\nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \\nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \\ngrown up daughters, they\\'re almost my age.\\n\\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \\nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn\\'t move, we might have\\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\\neleven o\\'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \\nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\\n. . . everything just like a war.\\n\\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \\nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she\\'s so proud \\nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \\nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \\nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \\nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \\nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \\nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn\\'t say anything. Mamma came in then, and \\nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I\\'ll give you a shot.\" \\nMamma tells him, \"I don\\'t need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \\nare they doing? Look what they\\'ve done to my children! They\\'re killing people,\\nand you\\'re just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \\nthere. \"You\\'re sitting here drinking tea! Look what they\\'ve done to my \\ndaughters! Look what they\\'ve turned them into!\" They gave her something to \\ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \\nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \\nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \\ndon\\'t know, maybe there weren\\'t any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What\\'s \\nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya\\'s.\\nI said, \"I\\'m fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \\nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \\nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What\\'s wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \\nsister Lyuda\\'s nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \\nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \\nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \\nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \\nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \\ndressed with something, but that they\\'d do that in the hospital.\\n\\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \\nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don\\'t \\nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn\\'t move.\" When\\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \\nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \\n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \\nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \\njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \\n\"Fine,\" but didn\\'t write it down and led him on. I don\\'t know where they were \\ntaking him.\\n\\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \\nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \\nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don\\'t \\nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \\nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \\nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you\\'re Armenians, they \\ndidn\\'t get along with you, but I\\'m a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \\nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \\nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \\ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \\nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don\\'t know \\nwhat they did to him, if he\\'s still alive or not. And something else. Before \\nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn\\'t think it was \\nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\\nwere throwing something they didn\\'t need out, or someone was fighting with \\nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \\nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\\n\\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \\nand said, \"I\\'ve been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \\nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \\nthat he\\'d been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \\nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That\\'s not my\\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I\\'ll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \\nI\\'ll find you one. I\\'ll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \\nto his apartment.\\n\\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \\ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \\nwasn\\'t surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \\nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn\\'t say anything--she\\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \\nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \\ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn\\'t even give us tea. All the women there soon\\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \\nzoo animals. Karina didn\\'t see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \\nseeing it.\\n\\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn\\'t have \\nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \\nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \\nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\\nIra was holding her daughter\\'s hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \\ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter\\'s hand, her daughter took her hand again.\\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she\\'s 11 years old. I felt really awful \\nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \\nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \\nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \\nwas simply Bartholomew\\'s Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \\nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\\n\\nMany are surprised that those animals didn\\'t harm the children. The beasts \\nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \\nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we\\'ll come take the \\npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \\nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \\nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \\nvictims testified to it. That\\'s how they described their own natures, that\\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\\nthemselves said that.\\n\\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn\\'t harm our Marina. Many \\npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don\\'t know \\nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn\\'t slept the night before, \\nmaybe for some other reason, I don\\'t know. But they hadn\\'t been smoking and \\nthey weren\\'t drunk, I\\'m positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \\nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \\nMarina: \"Little sister, don\\'t be afraid, we won\\'t harm you, don\\'t look over \\nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You\\'re a Muslim, a Muslim woman \\nshouldn\\'t see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\\n\\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \\nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn\\'t even a day, of those several \\nhours. Father still can\\'t look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he\\'s started talk-\\ning to himself, I\\'ve heard him argue with himself several times when he\\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he\\'ll say, \"what could I do? What could\\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don\\'t know where to find the words,\\nit\\'s not that I\\'m happy, but I am glad that he didn\\'t see it all happen. \\nThat\\'s the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \\ncourse he knows it all, but there\\'s no way you could imagine every last detail\\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don\\'t speak with Father present.\\n\\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \\nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \\nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \\nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \\nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik\\'s wife \\nand Grant\\'s daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\\n\\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\\nThere\\'s a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\\nbetter because it\\'s possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\\n\\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \\nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \\nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \\ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \\npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \\nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it\\'s electrified, but if they were \\nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \\ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn\\'t \\njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn\\'t slept for 24 hours, or 48,\\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \\nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \\nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn\\'t see a single\\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \\nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\\none another . . . That\\'s the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \\npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \\nhospital and didn\\'t know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \\nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \\nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \\nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \\nshe wouldn\\'t be able to take it.\\n\\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \\nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \\ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \\nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \\nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn\\'t eaten for two days and that people \\ndo eat.\\n\\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \\nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \\nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \\ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \\nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \\nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \\nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \\nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \\nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \\none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \\ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \\nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \\nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \\ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \\nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn\\'t really night, no one slept. She \\nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \\n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \\nraped, and you\\'re just sitting there. You\\'re sitting and talking as though \\nnothing had happened. Aren\\'t you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \\none got up. I was just numb, I didn\\'t have the strength to beat anyone, I \\ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \\nmany hours--I was released at eleven o\\'clock in the morning and it was already\\nafter ten at night because there weren\\'t enough chairs, really it was the \\nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \\nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \\nThe situation was deplorable.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \\nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They\\'ve brought mattresses, you can wash up\\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn\\'t want to leave this place, \\neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \\ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it\\'s our little \\nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \\nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn\\'t approach me,\\nI\\'m on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that\\'s all right.\" They hugged\\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\\n\\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \\nhere. Don\\'t be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it\\'s quiet in the city.\"\\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \\nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\\nI didn\\'t know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don\\'t worry, the\\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won\\'t rest assured regardless, because the staff in\\nthere is capable of anything.\"\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \\nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \\nhadn\\'t been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \\nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \\ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \\nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \\nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \\ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \\nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \\nwhat\\'s happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\\n\\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \\nwell and respect him highly. I\\'ve known him for a long time. They had a small \\nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \\ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \\nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \\nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \\nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \\nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \\nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn\\'t deign to speak with \\nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\\n\\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \\ntwo or three. We\\'re going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \\nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \\nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \\nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \\nMamma has arrived, she\\'s looking for you, she doesn\\'t believe that you are \\nalive and well and that you\\'re here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \\nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\\n\\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian\\'s\\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\\nGrigorian\\'s father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \\nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \\nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \\nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \\nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \\nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \\nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\\n\\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don\\'t remember how many dead were \\ncontained in the list, but it\\'s a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \\nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What\\'s \\ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\\nhim, so that he\\'d see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\\nshould ask everyone who hadn\\'t left for the Khimik boarding house all over\\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\\nthat\\'s the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \\npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \\na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn\\'t remember anyone else. But there\\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\\ndon\\'t count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \\nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren\\'t registered as victims of\\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn\\'t know. So many \\npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \\nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don\\'t have any information on them. I know that \\nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \\nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \\ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \\nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \\nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there\\'s\\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \\ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\\ndon\\'t know them all. I\\'m thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \\npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn\\'t take the matter to court, \\nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn\\'t cease being victims. One of them\\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \\n8, on the fifth floor. I can\\'t tell you the building number and I don\\'t know \\nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \\nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don\\'t know her name, she lives on the \\nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \\nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn\\'t hold the door forever, and \\nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors\\' they seized her by her \\nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \\nthey didn\\'t kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \\n. . . I don\\'t remember who the third one was anymore.\\n\\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn\\'t herself. Yes, we lived for\\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \\nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn\\'t stay with Karina; \\nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \\nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \\nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \\n\"If it weren\\'t for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \\nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \\nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \\ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \\nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\\n\\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \\nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\\n\\nShirokov was involved with Karina\\'s case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \\ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \\nWe didn\\'t work with the identikit until the very last day because the\\nconditions weren\\'t there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \\nquality work solely because the situation wasn\\'t conducive to working: there \\nweren\\'t enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \\ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \\nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We\\'re not so poor that \\nwe can\\'t supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \\nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \\nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \\nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don\\'t you worry, if it takes us a month or two \\nmonths, I\\'ll be here. I\\'m not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\\nthose two days, I\\'ll help you conduct the investigation.\"\\n\\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn\\'t have the time to get to\\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\\nrays. She couldn\\'t eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn\\'t eat\\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \\nthis? Well fine, so you don\\'t want to eat, you don\\'t love yourself, you\\'re\\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\\nwas exhausted. It wasn\\'t enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\\ncells and prisons. I don\\'t know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \\nconfinement.\\n\\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \\nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn\\'t identify \\nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren\\'t among the \\nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \\nwho went after the axe. He still hasn\\'t been detained, he\\'s still on the \\nloose. He\\'s gone, and it\\'s not clear if he will be found or not. I don\\'t know \\nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \\nsisters\\' faces. But he\\'s not in the city. The investigators informed me that \\neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \\ncontinue looking for him.\\n\\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \\nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\\nof me \"I\\'ll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\\na prison on Armenian soil. They\\'re all terribly afraid of that, because if the\\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn\\'t confess even\\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don\\'t confess, just keep silent. When you\\'re in an\\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they\\'ll take care of you\\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\\n\\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \\nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \\nall the valuables, but didn\\'t take a single book. They tore them up, burned \\nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \\nFenimore Cooper\\'s Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \\nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \\nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That\\'s \\nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don\\'t\\neven know anything about books. They didn\\'t take a single book, but they did \\ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \\nslippers.\\n\\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \\nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let\\'s use their word for \\nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \\none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \\nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \\nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \\ndon\\'t know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \\nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \\nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \\naxe. Murdering her wasn\\'t enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \\nthrew them into the tub with water.\\n\\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \\nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \\ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \\nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \\ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \\nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \\nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \\nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \\ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \\n\"You\\'re wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \\nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \\nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I\\'ll tell you one more\\nidentifying mark. If I\\'m wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \\nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \\npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn\\'t \\nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn\\'t wanted to do it, that they \\nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn\\'t \\nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \\nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \\nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \\nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don\\'t know how, \\nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \\nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \\nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it\\'s a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \\nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \\nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You\\'re \\nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \\nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don\\'t have any more strength or \\nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \\n. . . I don\\'t have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \\nthat high in gym class.\"\\n\\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \\nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \\nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\\n\\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \\nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \\n\"Tomorrow we\\'re going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\\no\\'clock.\" He said, \"No, I\\'m not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don\\'t come \\nwe\\'ll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I\\'ll come.\" And he went.\\n\\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \\nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \\nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we\\'re going to get\\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \\n\"I\\'m not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \\nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \\nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\\n\\nI\\'ll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don\\'t know if he participated in the rapes in our \\napartment; I didn\\'t see, I don\\'t remember. But the people who were in our \\napartment who didn\\'t yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \\ndon\\'t know if he confessed or not, and I myself don\\'t recall because I blacked\\nout very often. But I think that he didn\\'t participate in the rape of Karina\\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\\n\\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn\\'t \\nhave a father, and that he\\'s been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\\n\\nThe others who were detained . . . well they\\'re little beasts. You really can\\'t\\ncall them beasts, they\\'re just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\\nsomeone else\\'s will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don\\'t \\nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that\\'s why they did it. In the\\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\\nthat\\'s holy to them--that\\'s why they did everything they were commanded to do.\\nBecause I saw they didn\\'t have minds of their own, I\\'m not talking about their\\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \\ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \\npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \\npromised us apartments.\"\\n\\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \\nchildren\\'s home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \\nthe children\\'s home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \\nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn\\'t inherited from parents or \\ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn\\'t need anything I just don\\'t know . . . how\\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \\nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \\nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\\n\\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \\nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they\\'ll get onto him, they just \\nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \\nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \\nknew and those he didn\\'t, either, and other things as well, and changed \\nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn\\'t get onto him, but he was detained.\\n\\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians\\' after Aleksandr \\nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let\\'s go, enough, you\\'ve spilled\\nenough blood here.\"\\n\\nMaybe Karina doesn\\'t know this but the reason they didn\\'t finish her off was \\nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \\nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \\nKarina came to at one point--she doesn\\'t remember this yet, this the neighbors \\nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \\nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \\nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians\\'. They came back\\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \\nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \\nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \\nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\\nThe woman\\'s grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \\nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \\nhe sees everything, and He won\\'t forgive this.\\n\\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \\nfloor, she\\'s already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \\ntantamount to trampling a woman\\'s honor.\\n\\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \\nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \\nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \\nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it\\'s clear that \\nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \\nhave happened. All the same, I\\'m not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \\nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \\na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn\\'t have time to do everything, they \\nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \\nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\\n\\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \\ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \\nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \\na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \\nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \\nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \\nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \\nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \\nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \\nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \\ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn\\'t see the woman because \\npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \\nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \\ncut her daughters\\' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \\nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \\ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\\n\\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \\nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \\nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \\nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \\nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \\nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It\\'s our \\nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \\nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\\ntime immemorial, that\\'s the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \\nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \\nArmenians.\\n\\nI heard this. Before that I hadn\\'t been listening to the speeches closely.\\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \\nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn\\'t penetrate,\\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he\\'s saying, listen to what idiocy he\\'s \\nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \\nlistened to the woman\\'s speech.\\n\\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \\nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he\\'s an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \\nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \\nthey find out that you\\'re an Armenian they\\'ll tear you to pieces. Should I \\ntell them you\\'re an Armenian? Should I tell them you\\'re an Armenian?\" When he \\nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \\nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \\n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o\\'clock,.and men, until \\ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \\nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \\nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \\nAzerbaijani. I didn\\'t see them after that.\\n\\nWhen we were walking the buses weren\\'t running, and a crowd from the rally ran\\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \\nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \\noff. I wasn\\'t afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \\nwouldn\\'t say that I was an Armenian.\\n\\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \\nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\\nagain my parents didn\\'t understand that we were in danger. We watched \\ntelevision as usual, and didn\\'t even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \\nday. That\\'s how it all was.\\n\\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\\nZhanna, I don\\'t remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \\non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \\ndoesn\\'t have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \\nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \\nground was wet and that there wasn\\'t anyone behind the building when she went \\nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \\nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \\nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn\\'t feel any pain in the heat of the \\nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn\\'t stand up, she had been \\ninjured somehow. That\\'s how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \\nand their children: any way they could. \\n\\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father\\'s first cousin, \\nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \\nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \\nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \\nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \\ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \\nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \\nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \\nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she\\'s an \\nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\\nand told her that if she didn\\'t help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \\nescape alive and unharmed, she\\'d never see her daughter again. I\\'m sure, of \\ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \\nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \\npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \\npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \\nvery moment, into Block 30. That\\'s how they defended themselves.\\n\\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They\\'re big, \\nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \\nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\\n\\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \\nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \\npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \\ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \\nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \\nAzerbaijani corpses. I don\\'t know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \\nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \\ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \\nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \\ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \\nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \\nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \\ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \\nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \\nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\\n\\nRaya\\'s husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \\nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\\nAzerbaijani victims, although we\\'ll never hear anything about them. For some \\nreason our government doesn\\'t want to say that the Armenians were not just \\nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \\nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \\nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that\\'s not \\nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \\nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \\nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we\\'ve \\nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\\n\\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\\nthat it\\'s not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \\nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \\nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\\ntion. That\\'s the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \\nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we\\'re Armenians, and to not fear\\nspeaking our native tongue.\\n\\n   October 15,1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

My guess\\nis that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in\\npolitical criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as\\nagents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them.\\nAt least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to\\nIsraeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt\\nto influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters\\nwill be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law\\nentitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my\\nprevious posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation\\neven in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further\\ndissemination of certain types of private information about them.\\n--\\nYigal Arens\\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\\narens@isi.edu\\n\"),\n",

In 1941, \\nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \\ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \\nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \\ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \\ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \\nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \\nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \\nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \\nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler\\'s policy of \\nextermination of the Jews.\\n\\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\\n\\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \\n\\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \\nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \\nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \\nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \\nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One British\\nsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the\\ndisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. \\n\\nRawlinson wired to his superiors, \\n\\n\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in\\n independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops \\n being without discipline and not being under effective control,\\n atrocities were constantly being committed.\" \\n\\n>Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:\\n\\nCome again?\\n\\n: \"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...\\n>(34 lines deleted)\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n: No wonder you are in such a mess.

But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\\n|> Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\\n|> serves no other purpose ?\\n\\nA number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner\\nin which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,\\nand tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For\\ncitizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves\\non a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,\\nis for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place\\nin banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...\\nQuite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card\\nfor such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or\\nrequirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.\\nFurthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against\\nthe bearer in any manner by having access to this information.\\n\\nThe only case that I can think of in which the Le\\'um field might\\nbe taken into account is during interaction with the police,\\nbased upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are\\nclearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore\\nbecomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field\\nis being used to discriminate against them officially.\\n\\n\\n|> In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\\n|> Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel\\'s borders were\\n|> \\'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace\\'. According to what I\\n|> read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\\n|> plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\\n|> Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\\n|> Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel\\'s borders, when Israel was\\n|> established, as this might restrict Israel\\'s opportunities for\\n|> later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\\n|> fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\\n|> land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\\n|> promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\\n|> borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\\n|> today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can\\'t it declare what\\n|> it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\\n|> base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\\n|> cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\\n|> number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\\n\\nI take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries\\ndo know that they have nothing to fear from \"Israeli expansionism\".\\nMilitarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of\\nland under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a\\nsustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing\\nthe Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli\\nwithdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the\\nAwali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal\\nstrip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.\\nPublic opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada\\nvia territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from\\nbattle fatigue of sorts and the gov\\'t is aware of it.\\n\\nWith regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree\\nwith the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux\\nof the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating\\na starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal\\nand a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,\\nthe negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state\\nsmaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller\\nborders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be\\nsettled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic\\nand sensible.\\n\\n|> Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\\n|> official. I don\\'t think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\\n|> Vanunu\\'s revelations about Israel\\'s nuclear arsenal without\\n|> evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\\n|> the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\\n|> should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\\n\\nYour statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a \"center for\\npolicy research\".  Whether or not all of Vanunu\\'s revelations were true has no\\nbearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing \"state secrets\"\\nafter having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that\\nsaid secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.\\nAs to which were and which weren\\'t, I am under no moral obligation\\nto disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.\\nHe was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue\\nwith a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the\\nconcept of \"Secrets of state\", something which every democratic govt\\nhas.\\n\\n|> Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\\n|> \\'hidden prisoners\\' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\\n|> Ma\\'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\\n|> exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\\n\\nI noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist\\nmore than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,\\nwhich you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such\\nreports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,\\nas tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not\\nmade public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know\\nabout it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be\\nmade public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.\\nThis would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an\\nannouncement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.\\n\\n|> You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\\n|> way to \\'cast aspersions upon Israel\\'.

This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\\n\\nWell, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such\\nquestions are often termed \"tabloid journalism\" and are not\\ndisturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.\\nSuch questions were often used during the McCarthy era as\\na basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use\\nyour own example, these questions might have been lifted\\nfrom the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking\\nfor small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray\\nas a larger and dirtier picture.\\n\\nMy answers were not any more \"hysterical\" than the questions\\nthemselves.  The problem is not that the q\\'s were provocative,\\nit was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You\\nfall into the same category of those who seek \"yes\" \"no\" answers\\nwhen the real answer is \"of sorts\".\\nI suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an\\nunequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete\\nthem as you see fit.

It is to those\\nwho read with open mind, that I address myself.\\n\\n%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\\n%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the\\n%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member\\n%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial\\n%discrimination as \"any distinction, exclusion, restriction or\\n%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic\\n%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing\\n%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of\\n%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,\\n%social, cultural or any other field of public life.\"\\n\\nWhile the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,\\nas the text currently stands I know of no country in which\\nracial discrimination of some sort can not be found.\\nIt makes no mention of the need for for a legislative\\nviolation.\\n\\n%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining\\n%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The\\n%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since\\n%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli\\n%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of\\n%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United\\n%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial\\n%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.\\n\\nIf you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative\\nstatements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be\\napplied to any other case where the council perceives some form\\nof racial discrimination as previously exhibited.\\n\\nScarey thought.\\n\\n%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of\\n%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native\\n%non-Jews born in that country. \\n\\nActually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not\\nalienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be\\ncorrect, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes\\napparent.  This slant permeates the text.\\n\\n%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas\\n%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most\\n%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the\\n%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.\\n\\nThe above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting\\nBeduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.\\nYour own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the\\nissue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].\\n\\n%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It\\'s aim\\n%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant\\n%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).\\n\\nIf I recall correctly, at the time \"zionism\" took off, there\\nwas no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any\\nfactual contradictory evidence .\\n\\n%But the\\n%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and\\n%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the\\n%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native\\n%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and\\n%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could\\n%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000\\n%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.\\n\\nDo you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on \"most\\nof their villages\"?\\n\\n%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to\\n%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their\\n%political repression and their destitution.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later\\nused for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the\\nintention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was\\nthat this was not the case.\\n\\nYou also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded\\nthis.  As you do again, below.\\n\\n%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied\\n%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus\\n%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its\\n%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered\\n%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security\\n%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and\\n%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these\\n%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.\\n\\nNot quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,\\nthough it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.\\nIsrael never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other\\nannexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.\\n\\n%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,\\n%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of\\n%international law and UN resolutions.\\n\\nOut of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,\\nwhat int\\'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories\\ncaptured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country\\npreviously (other than Iraq) ?\\n\\n%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under\\n%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as\\n%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a\\n%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).\\n\\nIncorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against\\non an \"ethnic or racial\" basis.  Therefore your above statement is\\nincorrect.\\n\\nI also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,\\nthe only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.\\nHowever, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist\\nat the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not\\nargue racial discrimination during that period!\\n\\n%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a\\n%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that\\n%represents them in world affairs.\\n\\nOnce again, some do, some don\\'t.\\n\\n%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab\\n%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant\\n%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.\\n\\nAnother generalization, but then again, you don\\'t seem to care\\nabout anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you\\nespouse.\\n\\n%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the\\n%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject\\n%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be\\n%challenged in court.\\n\\nIncorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.\\nFurthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all\\nof the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some\\nare, but this is not due to the \"whims\" of the military as\\nmuch as the sizeof the task/organization.\\n\\n%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied\\n%territories are permitted to carry firearms.\\n\\nIncorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in\\nDaheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of\\nthe intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.\\n\\n%Jewish settlers have\\n%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents\\n%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel\\n%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in\\n%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will\\n%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates\\n%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish\\n%settlement.\\n\\nThat is no longer true, and I can\\'t help but wonder what your\\npurpose is/was in posting this.\\n\\n%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them\\n%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For\\n%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected\\n%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by\\n%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish\\n%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and\\n%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to\\n%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in\\n%practice.\\n\\nOnce again, to hell with the other minorities that don\\'t fit in,\\nright?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way\\nyou seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but\\nas a result of what actions?\\n\\n%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the\\n%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are\\n%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on\\n%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these\\n%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied\\n%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in\\n%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews\\n%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government\\n%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of\\n%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;\\n%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their\\n%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and\\n%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian\\n%children are denied the right to learn their history and\\n%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end\\n%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the\\n%authorities.\\n\\n1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.\\n    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no\\n    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish\\n    collective.\\n\\n2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind\\n    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has\\n    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large\\n    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case \\n    in point.\\n\\n3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation\\n    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously\\n    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.\\n    It is based upon Jordan\\'s school system.\\n\\n4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another\\n    gross generalization.  \\n\\n%The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of\\n%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never\\n%openly endorsed the \\'transfer\\' idea (the forced removal from the\\n%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its\\n%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards\\n%non-Jews bear the mark of this \\'Final Solution\\'. No attempt is\\n%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs\\n%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately\\n%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen\\n%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of \\n%ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme\\n%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in\\n%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the\\n%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.\\n\\nAnother generalization, but lets not stop here.\\nThe transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov\\'t,\\nMoledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the\\nterritories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,\\nI recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered\\npreviously.\\n\\n%Although sexual\\n%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,\\n%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal\\n%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system\\n%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.\\n\\nWhen was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,\\nnor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious\\nintervention is best answered by the proportional representation and\\nthe lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.\\n\\n%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on\\n%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has\\n%not produced any written Constitution. \\n\\nSimply incorrect.\\nThe answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the\\ndynamics and movements inside Israeli gov\\'t, relegates your\\ncontentions to the sidelines.\\n\\n%Zionism predicates a state\\n%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,\\n%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak\\n%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli\\n%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be\\n%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial\\n%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only\\n%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the\\n%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.\\n\\nBut the discrimination is not based upon race.\\nOops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.\\n\\n%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that\\n%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -\\n%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed\\n%to fail.\\n\\nReal world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.\\nOf course, I wouldn\\'t expect you to understand, wrapped up as\\nyou are in your VIEW of things.  Let\\'s not let anything penetrate\\nshall we!?!

At that village, whose name was publicized\\nthroughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had\\nfour killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was\\nnearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab\\ntroops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting\\nwas thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated\\nthroughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian\\npopulation of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the\\nbattle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed\\nat the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,\\nchildren and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the\\nslopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw\\naway the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own\\nrisk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants\\nobeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their\\nstone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy\\nwas murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent\\ntestimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to\\novercome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the\\ncivilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable\\ncasualties.\\n\\n    \"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of\\nrevolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We\\nnever broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in\\naccordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am\\nconvinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single\\nunnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw\\nstones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do\\nwell not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].\\n\\n    \"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency\\nfound it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.\\nBen Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called \\'the wise\\nruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.\\' The \\'wise\\nruler,\\' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the\\nbodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal\\nsuperciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews\\nwere all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of\\n\\'dissidents.\\' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave\\nof lying propaganda was let loose about \\'Jewish attrocities.\\'\\n\\n    \"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the\\nresult it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.\\nKolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the\\nHaganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.\\nBeit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main\\nroad; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the\\nHaganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the\\nrest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even\\nbefore they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir\\nYassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the\\nway to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir\\nYassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the\\nconquest of Haifa.\"\\n\\n\\n[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \"To counteract the loss\\nof Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at\\nRamallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by\\nIrgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish\\nofficials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this\\nArab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced\\nto reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of\\nevil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of\\nterror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at\\nthe mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen\\nbattalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre\\' lie\\nis still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\"\\n\\n[2] In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews.\\n'),\n",

Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\\n\\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\\n\\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\\nEurope\\'s workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\\nJewish state.\\n\\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the \\'Jewish\\nproblem\\'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\\nbe considered by German Jews.\\n\\nThe best example of this was the \\'Transfer Agreement\\' of 1934.\\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\\nout, the campaign would collapse.\\n\\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\\nrace, nation, and the nature of the \\'Jewish problem\\', and it\\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\\n\\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\\n\\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany\\'s Jews out of\\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\\n\\'helping\\' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\\nJews come and agree with them.\\n\\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the \\'new\\nJew\\' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\\n\\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\\n\\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen\\'s play\\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\\n\\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner\\'s\\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary\\'s Jews to\\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\\nconditions were met.\\n\\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\\nwork camps.\\n\\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\\ndestruction: the trains of \\'prominents\\' which Eichmann promised to\\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\\nJews.\\n\\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\\n\\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\\nJews.\\n\\nTo conclude, the role played by Zionists in this period, was\\nconnected to another role they could, and should have played, that\\nof alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. They\\nhad the information, but politically it was contrary to their\\npriorities. The priorities were, and still are, quite simple: All\\nthat furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed,\\nwhatever the price. The lives of individuals, Jews and non-Jews,\\nare secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists,\\nNazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, so\\nbe it.\\n\\n'),\n",

It can be easily inferred \\nfrom the facts on the ground and from the information \\nprovided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition, \\nthough. The torrents of claptrap about \"the peace \\nprocess\" must be totally ignored, as must Israel\\'s official \\npronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality. \\nBy concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent \\nthat Labour\\'s policies were no different from those of \\nShamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their \\nmore effective implementation.\\n\\nLikud\\'s policies were accurately described by Ariel \\nSharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot \\nAharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a \\ndivision of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip \\ninto four, \"autonomous\" Palestinian enclaves, all of them \\nunder Israeli supervision. The total area of these \\nenclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the \\nterritories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli \\nsettlements and the highways built around the enclaves. \\nThe entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of \\nRamallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already \\nbeen turned into a \"Greater Jerusalem\" where the Arab-\\ninhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded \\nby areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for \\nthem.\\n\\nJudging from Labour\\'s settlement policy, it may be \\nassumed that it may content itself with a lesser number \\nof Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had \\nplanned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by \\nsettlements strategically dispersed along the highways \\nremains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in \\nthe West Bank: two in \"Samaria\" and two in \"Judea\" (i.e. \\nnorth and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more \\nthan two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to \"Greater \\nJerusalem\", Labour\\'s policies hardly deviate from \\nSharon\\'s.\\n\\nA saner version of Likud policy\\n\\nAs some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour \\npolicies were but a saner version of Sharon\\'s \\nextravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot \\nAharonot that, while \"barely a few months ago\" Labour \\nsupported the demand to freeze all construction beyond \\nthe Green Line, \"no specific decision to freeze \\nconstruction in the territories has been taken\". And Uzi \\nBenziman wrote in Ha\\'aretz that \"as far as can be judged \\non the basis of the internal political discussions in \\nJerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud\\'s ways\".\\n\\nThe two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are \\nlocated in \"Samaria\". Therefore the belt of settlements \\naround the \"Trans-Samaria Highway\", designed to \\nseparate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount \\nimportance. According to the latest data, the percentage \\nof Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population \\n(apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But \\nfor the area around the \"Trans-Samaria Highway\", the \\ncorresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is \\nincreasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of \\nthe \"Efrat Block\" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever \\nthe enclave around Bethlehem from the one around \\nHebron, is pretty much the same. The \"Efrat Block\" is now \\nbeing connected with West Jerusalem by a highway.\\n\\nThe project is costly in the extreme, because the highway \\nis designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long \\ntunnels. The final decision to build this highway was \\nsuspended until Rabin\\'s return from his US visit in \\nMarch. The subsequent decision to renew its construction \\ncan be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a \\nwhole.\\n\\nProcess of impoverishment\\n\\nThe enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady \\nimpoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known \\nin Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be \\nconcerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip, \\nthe whole process was best described by Ze\\'ev Shiff in \\nHa\\'aretz in March. He mentions having seen \"a pamphlet \\nissued six years ago by the Civil Administration \\nforecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli \\nrule in 2000\". His analysis deserves to be quoted \\nextensively:\\n\\n\"We continue to steal the Strip\\'s water, even though its \\nquality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to \\nsteal the Strip\\'s tiny land resources, in order to found \\nthere more and more settlements, as if we deliberately \\nwant to make the inhabitants despair, and in their \\ndespair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is \\nby our own doing that the Strip\\'s workers must now \\nspend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time \\nas they spend working. From the military point of view, \\nwe have kept control of no more than half the Strip\\'s \\narea at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and \\nresources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the \\ndefence ministry, I heard him saying that we should \\nwithdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument \\nwas that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and \\ndeeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak \\nShamir but he rejected it.\" Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too.\\n\\nEnormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can \\nalso be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being \\nimplemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by \\nthe first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to \\ndivide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim \\nDavidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli \\nthis enterprise is. \"The Qatif Block is now producing 40 \\nper cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a \\nsubstantial proportion of cut flowers.\" He also deals with \\nthe subsidies the settlers receive, considerably \\naugmented by the present government. Owing to them, \\nhousing units are cheap. The present government does \\nnot spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. \\n\"Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage \\nfor his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels \\n($6,500).\"\\n\\nSuch data shows that Israel\\'s plans apply whether the \\nPalestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to \\nwork in Israel. The economic motivations were explained \\nby Danny Rubinstein in Ha\\'aretz in March:\\n\\n\"From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be \\nsealed off hermetically and all the Strip\\'s workers could \\nbe barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate \\ndata is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the \\nlast two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving \\ndaily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from \\n80,000 in the mid\\'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease \\nis not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel \\nfrom Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of \\ndemand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment \\nin Israel soaring and the construction of apartments \\nblocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no \\nlonger really needed...\"\\n\\nGaza\\'s total dependence\\n\\nThe entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent \\non Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has \\nbeen an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli \\nfactories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of \\nsmall workshops, employing an average of four workers, \\nget their raw materials or unfinished products, together \\nwith detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories. \\nRubinstein attributes this development to the fact that \\n\"the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent \\nof that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the \\naverage wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer \\ndoes not pay any social security for his employees.\" If \\nthe average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that \\nin Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of \\nPalestinian sub-contractors must be vast.\\n\\nThey are higher still when \"a Gazan sub-contractor \\nprovides labour to be performed at home, with the \\nfamily\\'s help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of \\nGazans depends on such sub-contracted work.\" Many of \\nthem are women and children, paid about ten shekels \\n($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can \\nbe no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan \\nlabour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition \\nof Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from \\nthe Strip.\\n\\nEconomic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from \\nwhat was created straight after Israel\\'s conquest [in \\n1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the \\ntalk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures \\nintended to \"encourage economic development in the \\nterritories\", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits \\nfor opening new businesses depend on a prior approval \\nby the Shin Bet. \"Behind all the professed goodwill there \\nis no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good \\ncolonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the \\nnatives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not \\nbecome rebellious, and never do anything against the \\ninterests of the metropolis, its economic interests \\nincluded,\" wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The \\ndevelopment of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip \\naccords perfectly with Sela\\'s diagnosis.\\n\\nSela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. \\n\"In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in \\nmotion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from \\nthe threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is \\nsimplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds \\nin persuading the government, or even the trade and \\nindustry minister alone, a military order is issued \\nprohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this \\ndoes not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a \\nlicence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse \\nits production.\" Among the most active of such lobbies is \\nthe agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports \\nof Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) \\nnot only to Israel but also to Europe, where they \\notherwise might compete with Israeli exports.\\n\\nPerpetuaring apartheid\\n\\nLabour\\'s goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in \\nthe territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which \\notherwise could not support the Labour government so \\nfirmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels \\nhappier about supporting Labour than Likud is its \\ngreater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This \\npoint was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma\\'ariv, who \\ndeplored the settlers\\' failure which he attributed to \\nLikud\\'s inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly \\nsettlement growth \"occured during the term of office of \\nthe National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which \\nRabin served throughout as the defence minister\". \\nLikud\\'s reputation for settling the territories better than \\nLabour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements \\nwithout strategic value founded under Shamir for \\nsymbolic reasons.\\n\\nTo sum up: Labour\\'s policy, unconditionally supported by \\nthe US differs from that of Likud primarily in the \\nefficiency with which it is implemented. According to \\nthat policy the territories are to be divided into two \\nparts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly, \\nand the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist \\nscheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying \\nprice in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is \\nrecognised, the less suffering it may cause.\\n\\n************************************\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

My pal fired three bullets, two at the\\n> Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\\n> him straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled off\\n> something.\\n>\\n> Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\\n> in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\\n> spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\\n> blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shut\\n> up\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\\n> straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\\n> something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'All\\n> right, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look at\\n> another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\\n> saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\\n> help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\\n> this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\\n> into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\\n> I was becoming mad.

Well, this is probably as accurate as the rest of\\nthis fantasy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n> hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\\n> We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\\n> deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\\n> saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\\n> such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\\n> inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\\n> the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\\n> had hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\n> so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\n> revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\n> distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\n> bullets sinking in.

But do we write about historical ownership of any\\nplace - Palestine, Pakistan, Cyprus, Aegean Islands (and the oil that\\nmay lie beneath them), whatever - for any reason other than\\njustification for stomping others?\\n\\nDOES IT TRULY MATTER whose ancestor lived where 20, 200, or 2000 years\\nago?  More than how you treat the land and each other?\\n\\nWho is wise enough to decree that a person\\'s right to life, liberty\\nand pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents of\\nbirth?  Who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the sperm\\nthat birthed the people we wish to despise?\\n\\nIMHO, the American Indians have it right.  We belong to the earth, it\\ndoes not belong to us.  Failure to understand that is a good way to\\ncause lossage all the way around.  My guess is that once we trash our\\nenvironment sufficiently we shall die along with it - the baby eating\\nand killing its mother, then dying for lack of milk.\\n\\nDeath and disease do not respect national boundaries, not as toxins,\\ndisease vectors,  lost farmland/wetlands/forest cover/water supplies,\\nnor any other way.  When we fight over which national group owns which\\npiece of turf, we are merely contending for the best vantage point\\nfrom which to kill others, \"our\" land and eventually ourselves.\\n\\nThat is something of which to be proud.  Very proud.  Makes me glad to\\nbe human.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism.  Maybe it\\'s fair to ask\\nwhether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that\\nall _my_ ancestors (hah!) labored to produce.  But it\\'s an artificial\\ndistinction: is the recent immigrant, even a refugee, less likely to\\ncontribute to the next generation\\'s legacy than anyone else?  [In\\nhistory the reverse is often the case: recent immigrants strive\\nhardest.  If nothing else, they fill open eco(l/n)ogic niches.]\\n\\nThen again, my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe, so I can\\nunderstand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off.  While I, of\\ncourse, will make sure it doesn\\'t happen, even if I must shoot Muslim\\ninfants (or bash Jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to do\\nso.  That\\'ll prove my moral superiority, by golly, as well as the\\nrightness of my cause.\\n\\n\\nClearly, there is no higher purpose in life than killing others\\nbecause they are not like you.  I would never get in the way of such\\nfun.\\n\\nLet\\'s see:  \\n\\tsoc.culture.turkish - Why don\\'t you Turks go back to Lake\\n\\t\\tBaikal where you came from, and leave the land to the\\n\\t\\tGreeks, who stole it fair and square from the\\n\\t\\tScythians?\\n\\tsoc.culture.pakistan - Why don\\'t you guys redistribute\\n\\t\\tyourselves over India, as God meant for you to do?\\n\\tsoc.culture.jewish, soc.culture.arabic - we stick together,\\n\\t\\tfight together, die together.

Although he left the detention installation\\n> in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\"I sat at home for ten days.

He doesn\\'t speak or\\n> react. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early\\n> August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left\\n> it one day later - dead. \"We have recently received an especially\\n> large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at\\n> the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\", noted\\n> Dr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and\\n> Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights.

Obviously, Israel will keep some, and the Arabs\\nwill get some.\\n\\nIsrael has tried to get out of Gaza almost from the time it got stuck\\nwith it.  It has been refused by the Arabs several times.  Although\\nthere are some Israelis who are extremely reluctant to give it up, I\\nseriously doubt Israel will keep more than a tiny portion of it in any\\nsettlement.\\n\\nThe Golan Heights is a serious security problem, and Israel obviously\\nwill have to keep part of it and give up part of it.  (One should\\nremember that the Golan Heights had been part of the area that was to\\nbe in Britain's Palestine Mandate, slated to become part of the Jewish\\nstate, until Britain traded it to France for other considerations.

By putting on uniforms and living apart\\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\\nthe risk to civilians.\\n\\n\\tBut if the guerillas do this aren\\'t *they* putting themselves\\n\\tat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \"why set \\n\\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \\n\\tcover for us (civilians)?

BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \\nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\\n\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. \\n\\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"\\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn\\'t work very well.\\nThe \"host\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \\nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \\non the civilians caught in their path.  \\n>\\n>|> What?So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \\n>|> can start all over again?

By your\\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\\n\\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \\nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already.

Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians\\' words?\\nSince they don\\'t, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \\n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\".

Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\n   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\n   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\n   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\n   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\n   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\n   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\n   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\n   are back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\n   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\n\\nSome of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you\\ndescribe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,\\nbacked by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah\\nand Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,\\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\\n\\n   Israel\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\n\\nWell, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\\nthe Lebanese gov\\'t was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\\nit and prevent further attacks.\\n\\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\n   would have resulted in.  \\n\\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\\n\\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\\n\\nNo, the Syrian gov\\'t is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\\nLebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.\\n\\n   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\n   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\nNo, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.\\n\\n--\\nShai Guday              | Stealth bombers,\\nOS Software Engineer    |\\nThinking Machines Corp. |\\tthe winged ninjas of the skies.\\nCambridge, MA           |\\n'),\n",

Since,  however, I agree with those who  \\nclaim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  \\nbank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  \\nto attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  \\npromptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  \\npossession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  \\nnational suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  \\nis that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  \\nand the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  \\ncontinues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  \\ncan launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  \\nBank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  \\nthe small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  \\nBank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even  \\nleftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't  \\ngoing to propose giving up Jerusalem.

Polymenakos) writes:\\n\\n> Well, ZUMABOT claims just the opposite: That Greeks are not allowing\\n>Turks to exit the country. Now, explain this: The number of Turks in\\n>Thrace has steadily risen from 50,000 in 23 to 80,000, while the Greeks of\\n\\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \\nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \\nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \\nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \\ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \\ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \\nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \\nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \\nreally happened. \\n\\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \\nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \\nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \\nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \\nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \\n\\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \\nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \\nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \\nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \\na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \\ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \\nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \\nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \\nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \\nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \\nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \\nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \\n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \\ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \\nand remains without a job. \\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\\n\\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \\nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \\ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \\nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \\nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \\nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \\nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \\nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \\nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \\nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \\nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \\ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \\nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \\nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\\n\\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \\ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \\nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\\n\\nNow wait, there is more.\\n\\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\\n\\n  pages 82-83:\\n\\n<< 1.

Amongst\\n   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a\\n   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities\\n   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.\\n\\n   2.

Could it be because\\n  the Israelis aren\\'t feasting?  Perhaps because the Gazans aren\\'t\\n  starving?\\n\\n# The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population\\n# density in the world,\\n\\n  Oh, oh.  I hadn\\'t realized that the Chinese had wiped out Hong\\n  Kong, or that Singapore had sunk into the sea, or that several\\n  other cities had vanished.  Either that, or this is a taste of\\n  the quality of \\'Research\\' we\\'re about to see.\\n\\n#                       has been cut off from the world for weeks.\\n\\n  So I suppose that the footage on CNN last night was archival,\\n  and Ted Turner was faking it after the NBC style?  Or is this\\n  another wee little exaggeration for the sake of a Greater Truth?\\n\\n# The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of\\n# Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the\\n# strip and seek work in Israel.\\n\\n  Hey!  You forgot that Israel has also denied Syrians the same\\n  \\'right\\'.  Come to think of it, Mexico is denying me that \\'right\\'\\n  evan as I write this!  Or are you ever so gently suggesting that\\n  Israel, unlike every other country on Earth, shouldn\\'t be allowed\\n  to control traffic across its borders?\\n\\n# While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the\\n# Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help\\n# the Gazan resistance.  The only help given to Gazans by Israeli\\n# Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.\\n\\n  This sounds like a parallel, but it isn\\'t.  Tell us how many Poles\\n  went into the Ghetto to join the Jews there.  Oops!  For a moment\\n  there I forgot that in Poland, \\'humanitarian assistance\" could\\n  get you killed.  Come to think of it, humanitarian assistance to\\n  the Gazans can get Israelis killed, too.  Except that in Gaza,\\n  it\\'s likely to be by a Gazan death squad in your own office.\\n\\n  So let\\'s keep the parallel.  Since the gross numbers aren\\'t the\\n  same, we\\'ll need a proportionality value.  Should we use:\\n    * Gazan vs Jewish initial population?\\n    * Gazan vs Jewish death rates?\\n    * Gazans vs Jews who survived five years of occupation?\\n    * Israelis vs Nazis attacked by the \\'resistance\\'?\\n    * Israelis vs Poles charged with aiding the victims?\\n  Since the two cases are so comparable, it shouldn\\'t matter\\n  which we pick, they\\'ll all be about the same, right?\\n\\n------------\\n\\nContrary to popular hyperbole, the IDF *could* quite easily kill\\noff the entire population of Gaza in hours if they wanted to.\\n(No, I\\'m not exaggerating.  And I really don\\'t want to discuss how.)\\nNote that a million dead Gazans don\\'t get much more headline\\nspace than a dozen, and are just as soon forgotten -- and once\\nexterminated, they can\\'t keep popping up as headlines.\\n\\nSo if a \"Final Solution\" for Gaza would be so much better from\\na *Realpolitik* standpoint, why doesn\\'t Israel go for it?  A\\ndifficult question to answer for those who can\\'t believe anything\\ngood about Jews, and probably why they keep trying to force-fit\\nthe facts into the theory.\\n\\n\\n--- D. C.

Was this an example of\\nQu\\'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for\\nyou... get into the \"soc.culture.arabic\" newsgroup where the posters have been\\ndebating the topic \"Jews in the Qu\\'ran\" (and may I remind you the people doing\\nthe debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu\\'ran).\\nYou will find that Jews aren\\'t really viewed positively by the Qu\\'ran (to put\\nit lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will\\nbe treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu\\'ran?  I think\\nthe 1948-1967 \"situation\" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you\\nthink?\\n\\n>However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their\\n>homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political\\n>thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the\\n>Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.\\n\\nAll I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - \"Jews in the Qu\\'ran\" and\\nthink again.  \"Freedom of choice\" is *definitely* not an option in Qu\\'ranic\\nlaw especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I\\'m sure\\nyou saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic\\nstate).\\n\\n>\\n>As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat\\'s mind.\\n>\\n\\nProbably nothing!

Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\\n\\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\\n  Empire.>>\\n\\n[47] Robert Mantran, \\'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle\\', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

I am an agnostic but still consider myself\\nJewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would argue\\nthat I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion of\\ndissent and debate isn\\'t it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by\\nconverting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most\\nopen nation.

Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.\\n\\nOne is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related\\npublic relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:\\n\\n1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade\\n   Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not\\n   succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created\\n   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist\\n   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.\\n\\n2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and\\n   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and\\n   outlaw state.\\n\\n3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I \\n   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and\\n   perhaps intensify.\\n\\nWhy this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have\\nbeen behind this. These include:\\n\\n1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical\\n   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This\\n   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily\\n   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this \\n   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return\\n   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of\\n   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian\\n   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian\\n   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.\\n   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news\\n   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.\\n\\n2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia\\n   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil\\n   sources from this region.\\n\\n3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense\\n   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of\\n   Soveit Union.\\n\\nThe recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed\\nfrom Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict\\nof interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the\\ninterest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal\\nand friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the\\nrise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\\n\\n--jamshid\\n'),\n",

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\\n\\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \\n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\\n\\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\\n and dirt...\\n\\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \\n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\\n\\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\\n\\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\\n\\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \\n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \\n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\\n \\'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.\\' Thus ten\\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\\n\\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\\n\\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \\n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \\n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\\n hatred and loathing.\\n\\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\\n\\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\\n\\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \\n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\\n children and old people. The women\\'s bodies had obvious marks of\\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\\n\\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \\n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel\\'s\\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\\n\\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\\n\\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\\n out the women\\'s heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \\n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \\n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \\n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\\n on the streets.\\n\\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\\n murdering an innocent Turk. \\n\\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \\n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: \\'How dare\\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?\\' In Erzurum, the \\n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \\n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\\n act. However no result was achieved.\\n\\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \\n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \\n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \\n\\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: \\'You are Russians.\\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.\\' The Armenians had a\\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\\n of the Turkish soldiers.\"\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

The 27th was a short day at\\nwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided\\nto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal\\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \\ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn\\'t have anything on her head, and \\nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They\\'re 40 to \\n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\\nthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?\\n\\nWhen I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn\\'t see what it was, \\nbut it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the \\nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\\naround it. I ask, \"What\\'s going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well\\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother\\nMuslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I\\ndidn\\'t understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \\nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \\nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\\nthe comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There\\'s\\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All \\nMoscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \\nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\\n\\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \\nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \\nthings, but I didn\\'t have any idea what was really going on.\\n\\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt\\'s house in Baku. \\nI didn\\'t say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\\no\\'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \\nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \\ndemonstration and move slowly.\\n\\nMy wife asks what\\'s going on out there. I say I don\\'t know. I put on some\\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\\npeople are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I\\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \\non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \\nand went against the traffic--it\\'s one way there--down the Street of the 26 \\nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \\nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \\nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \\nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\\n\\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\\nuneasy and said, \"No, let\\'s stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe \\nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn\\'t keeping track of the time, I can\\'t say\\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\\n\\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There\\'s noise, an uproar outside,\\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \\nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \\naggressive. No, I think, something\\'s wrong here, this isn\\'t any demonstration.\\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \\nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \\nfollowed them. I was thinking I\\'d just watch and see. Who knew where this was \\nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \\nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \\nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \\nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don\\'t need \\nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \\nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \\nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \\nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \\nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I\\'ve never seen it \\nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\\n\\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians\\' \\napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn\\'t \\nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \\ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \\nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn\\'t see any of them try \\nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\\n\\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\\n\\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\\nlor\\'s shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \\nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \\nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \\ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \\nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \\noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \\nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \\nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \\nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \\nhas a package in his hand, and he\\'s pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \\nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I\\'ve seen a lot of \\npeople smoke it, I\\'ve seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \\naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\\n\\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \\nI turned around and saw them running. Well I\\'ll just keep on going like I am, \\nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \\nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \\nstreet. He\\'s a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \\nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \\nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don\\'t really\\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father\\'s name is\\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \\nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \\nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \\ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \\nleft. Now Rafik\\'s little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \\nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \\nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \\nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \\ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\\n\\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It\\'s OK, it\\'ll pass, \\nthey\\'re young kids, they\\'ve just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn\\'t \\nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \\nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn\\'t \\nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine\\'s in motion. They weren\\'t \\nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn\\'t see people drinking \\nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn\\'t unloaded the vodka and \\nhashish to put in a store window!\\n\\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \\nwould stop them now, they weren\\'t even trying, although, I\\'ll say it again, \\nthe police were there, I saw them. And it\\'s not just that the police weren\\'t \\nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \\nTrue, at the time I couldn\\'t even imagine that under our government, our much-\\nvaunted leadership--and I\\'m not afraid to say these words: so many people \\ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \\ncouldn\\'t imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \\nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \\nSumgait, I couldn\\'t imagine that such things could take place.\\n\\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let\\'s go upstairs.\" \\nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \\nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \\nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \\nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \\nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \\ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \\nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \\nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \\nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\\n\\nWe spent the night at the neighbors\\'. My apartment was on the first floor,\\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\\n\\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \\nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \\nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \\nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \\nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\\nyou couldn\\'t even see him.\\n\\nThat was on the morning of February 28.

Let\\'s take a little\\n   stroll through a few of Elias Davidsson\\'s contributions to our \\n   understanding of the middle east.\\n \\nED> Quotations from Zionist leaders\\n\\nED> 1. \"There was no such thing as Palestinians\"\\nED> (Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel, London Sunday \\nED> Times, 15 June 1969)\\n\\n    And what do suggest that she meant by this?  Do you think she\\n    meant that the Palestinians don\\'t exist?

They are not all Jews now.  No\\n    Jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an Israel to\\n    be ONLY for Jews.  That was true then.  It is true now.  \\n\\n\\nED> \"[The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs.\"\\nED> (Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to \\nED> the Knesset,\\nED> quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, \\'Begin and the \"Beasts\", New \\nED> Statesman, 25 June 1982)\\n\\n    Since you inserted the words \\'The Palestinians are\\' we cannot\\n    know what Begin was talking about.  \\n    \\n    For someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an \\n    absurd pseudo-organizational name like the \\'Center for Policy\\n    Research,\\' you are not a very honest person. \\n\\n\\nED> \"Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians] \\nED> and the removal of the poor must be carried out \\nED> discreetly and circumspectly\".\\nED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, \\nED> 1960, I., p.88)\\n\\n    Herzl died eighty nine years ago.  Are you suggesting that he\\n    has stated what is Israel\\'s policy today?  Have you ever seen\\n    Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews, let alone  \\n    actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel?  If you actually \\n    believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel\\'s non-\\n    Jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot.  But if you realize\\n    that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis,\\n    then you are nothing but a common liar.  This one time I will \\n    give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you are stupid. \\n\\n \\nED> \"We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the \\nED> Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment \\nED> for it in the transit countries, while denying it any \\nED> employment in our own country\"\\nED> (Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960, \\nED> I, p.88)\\n\\n    Once again you quote a man gone for almost a century.  You do\\n    so within the context of modern day Israel.  \\n    \\n    Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.  How does this fact define the\\n    United States today?\\n\\n\\nED> \"[Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place\" \\nED> (David Ben Gurion, 1937, quoted in Shabtai Teveth, Ben \\nED> Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press, \\nED> 1985, p. 89)\\n\\n    Did he say \\'Jews,\\' or did you add this?\\n \\n    This was also a statement from ten years before Israel became\\n    a state.  It has no bearing on Israel.  \\n    \\n\\nED> \"We must do everything to ensure they [the \\nED> Palestinian refugees] never do return\"\\nED> (David Ben Gurion, in his diary, 19 July 1948, quoted in \\nED> Michael Bar Zohar, Ben Gurion: The Armed Prophet, \\nED> Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.157)\\n\\n    YOU added the words \\'the Palestinian refugees.\\'  And by doing\\n    so, you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion,\\n    who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands,\\n    at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH, and the  \\n    MUFTI OF JERUSALEM, was gloating over people abandoning their\\n    homes.  What he was refering to were the Arabs with whom Jews\\n    were at war.  \\n\\nED> \"The country was mostly an empty desert, with only \\nED> a few islands of Arab settlement\"\\nED> (Shimon Peres, Minister of Defense, quoted in David\\'s \\nED> Sling: The Arming of Israel, Weidenfeld and Nicholson, \\nED> 1970, p.249)\\n\\n    At the time of the rebirth of Israel this was certainly true,\\n    especially when compared to what Israel has accomplished in a\\n    few short decades.\\n\\n\\nED> \"All this story about the danger of extermination [of \\nED> Jews] has been blown up....to justify the annexation of \\nED> new Arab territories\"\\nED> (Mordechai Bentov, Israeli Cabinet Minister, Al \\nED> Hamishmar, 14 April 1972)\\n\\n    Since Israel has not annexed even one millimeter of territory \\n    in more twenty six years, this quote is irrelevant. \\n\\n\\nED> \"Neither Jewish ethics nor Jewish tradition can \\nED> disqualify terrorism as a means of combat\"\\nED> (Yitzhak Shamir, Hehazit, Summer 1943 [Journal of the \\nED> LEHI, the Stern Gang], translated from the Israeli daily \\nED> Al-Hamishmar, 24 December 1987\\n\\n    Again, you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had\\n    been promised from a time as ancient as biblical, to the time\\n    of the Balfour Declaration, just a few short years back.  And\\n    what was thought of and described as terrorism by Jews didn\\'t\\n    include slaughtering Olympic athletes, brutally murdering the \\n    innocent, attacking school buses, and murdering another human \\n    being for the sole reason that he or she is an Arab.\\n \\n \\nED> \"The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab \\nED> workers is a cancer in our body\"\\nED> (A. Uzan, Israeli Minister of Agriculture, Ha\\'aretz, 13 \\nED> December 1974)\\n\\n    There were serious concerns about a work force that consisted \\n    of people from OUTSIDE Israel.  It is a wise to be concerned.\\n    A work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation\\n    for a country.\\n\\n\\nED> \"There can be only one national home in Palestine, \\nED> and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership \\nED> between Jews and Arabs\"\\nED> (Montague David Eder, President of the Zionist \\nED> Federation of Great Britain, 1931,\\nED> in Doreen Ingrams, comp., Palestine Papers 1917-1922, \\nED> Seeds of Conflict, George Braziller, 1973, p. 135)\\n\\n    This also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years\\n    after this statement was made.  Obviously times change.  This\\n    is NOT what Israel is about today.  I believe the peace talks\\n    make this quote irrelevant.\\n\\n\\nED> \"There is not a single Jewish village in this country \\nED> that has not been built on the site of an Arab village\"\\nED> (Moshe Dayan, Ha\\'aretz, 4 April 1969...)\\n\\n    This is completely false.\\n\\n\\nED> \"Some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000 \\nED> Arabs in the event of a new war, and instruments have \\nED> been prepared\"\\nED> (Aharon Yariv, former chief of Israeli military \\nED> intelligence, 1980, Inquiry, 8 December 1980)\\n\\n    Expelled from where?  Israel?  The occupied territories?  New\\n    Jersey?  Is there any way we can read this and get an idea as\\n    to what on earth he was talking about.  Obviously not.\\n\\n \\nED> \"We should there [in Palestine] form a portion of the \\nED> rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization \\nED> as opposed to barbarism.\"\\nED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Jewish State, London, 1896, p. \\nED> 29)\\n\\n    Interesting notion.  Considering that this was written nearly\\n    a century ago, it is quite visionary.\\n\\n\\nED> \"I deeply believe in launching preventive war \\nED> against the Arab States without further hesitation. By \\nED> doing so we will achieve two targets: firstly, the \\nED> annihilation of Arab power; and secondly, the expansion \\nED> of our territory\"\\nED> (Menachem Begin, in a speech to the Knesset, 12 October \\nED> 1955)\\n\\n    This was said nearly forty years ago.  Begin is dead.  And it\\n    should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist,\\n    it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it\\n    captured them.  Israel would not be negotiating to get rid of\\n    them.\\n\\n\\nED> \"During the last 100 years our people have been in a \\nED> process of building up the country and the nation, of \\nED> expansion, of getting additional Jews and additional \\nED> settlements in order to expand the borders here. Let no \\nED> Jew say that the process has ended. Let no Jew say that \\nED> we are near the end of the road.\"\\nED> (Moshe Dayan, Ma\\'ariv, 7 July 1968)\\n\\n    He\\'s dead, too.  And since Israel has not annexed ANY land at \\n    all since 1967, you are once again wasting bandwidth with all\\n    of these misleading quotes.  They are so out of sync with the\\n    reality of Israel, that you do nothing but make yourself look\\n    like a fanatic desperate to sway people, by misleading them.\\n\\n\\nED> \"Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian \\nED> Arab] murderers. Who are we that we should argue \\nED> against their hatred ? For eight years now they sit in \\nED> their refugee camps in Gaza, and before their very eyes, \\nED> we turn into our homestead the land and the villages in \\nED> which they and their forefathers have lived.

It\\'s true that we should never lose sight\\n    of the plight of these people.  We should also recognize that\\n    this quote preceded the disgusting wave of Arab terrorism and\\n    violence directed at innocent people, that began in 1972 with \\n    the massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich, and continues \\n    to this day.\\n\\n    If your ability to obscure was the equal of your desire to do\\n    so, truthseekers in this group would have a problem.  But you\\n    are an easily recognized fanatic, whose stream of misleading,\\n    partial, and out-of-context quotes are totally  unfettered by\\n    the burden of truth.  \\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Questions to Israelis\\n\\n\\nTo:  shaig@Think.COM\\n\\nSubject: Ten questions to Israelis\\n\\nDear Shai,\\n\\nYour answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.\\n\\nIn the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of\\nIsraeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have\\nreceived from other quarters, according to which there are two\\ndistinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship\\n(Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports\\netc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I\\nam told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all\\ntimes and present them at many public places, almost every day.\\nThese ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.\\nYou maintain that this mainly because of religious services\\nprovided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\\nCould you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\\nserves no other purpose ?\\n\\nIn the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\\nIsrael has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were\\n'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I\\nread, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\\nplans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\\nTransjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\\nBen-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was\\nestablished, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for\\nlater expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\\nfact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\\nland to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\\npromised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\\nborders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\\ntoday ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what\\nit considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\\nbase for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\\ncannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\\nnumber of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\\n\\nYour answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\\nofficial. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\\nVanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without\\nevaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\\nthe truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\\nshould he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\\n\\nSomebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\\n'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\\nMa'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\\nexist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\\n\\nYou imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\\nway to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been\\nused by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet\\nUnion into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they\\nwould not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are\\nclearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be\\nvery happy if you could convince me that what I am told about\\nIsrael were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.\\nI suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest\\ndiscussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\\n\\nI hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.\\n\\n\"),\n",

If people are offended by what I say than I just\\nmay be too bad. This conflict, as is human conflict in general, is rather \\nbleak and is surrounded by the most barbaric actions of man. Given such \\nconditions, dispassion is rather difficult, and artificial at best. This does \\nnot mean that discussion is out of the question. No conflict is ever resolved \\nwithout discussion.\\n\\n[A] I\\'ll try first. Recently I received a message from\\n[A] a Russian guy who frequently visited Baku that \\n[A] approximately after 1986 the old situation when \\n[A] there were no anti-Armenian press had changed and\\n[A] the press became very anti-Armenian and average\\n[A] Azeri became an Armenian-hater. This is devastation \\n[A] news for me because one of my cornerstones was the fact\\n[A] that I MYSELF SAW ARMENIANS IN BAKU AMONG OTHER ETHNIC\\n[A] GROUPS AND SAW, OR HEARD, OR READ NOTHING THAT WOULD\\n[A] SEEM LIKE HATRED. You might say that an outsider never \\n[A] sees, but by that time I was myself victimized as a member\\n[A] of a minority by Russians and knew what to look for and\\n[A] what innocent sign or remark might signify.\\n\\nI am sure. The Soviet Union effectively froze in time all ethnic problems it\\ncreated or was brewing just after WWI. During the Soviet reign, officials \\ntended to shape the frozen conflicts in such a way so when thawed, they \\nwould serve the purposes of the internal policies of the Soviet Union or\\nsuccessor states.\\n\\n[A] Again - one of my cornerstones show cracks. I will investigate.\\n[A] Another cornerstone of my thought is that Armenia started\\n[A] hostilities against Azeris in Armenia before anything happened\\n[A] in Sumgait (not at all I am trying to justify violence in Sumgait\\n[A] or anywhere else - I bow my head with grief and respect and \\n[A] did demand and will laways demand that criminals be severely\\n[A] punished according to the law of the land.\\n[A] I would like you to supply me with the information about that.\\n[A] Does or does not the hostilities began in Armenia? Was thousands\\n[A] od Azeris thrown out of their homes and forced to leave Armeina\\n[A] before Sumgait or not? \\n\\nSumgait took place in February of 1988. The Azeris of Armenia were expelled\\nin the late fall of 1988. It took the entire summer of 1988 for the\\nsituation to get so bad for Azeris in Armenian that the Russians had to\\nevacuate them. I refer specifically to _Human Rights Violations in Armenia\\nand Azerbaijan_, A report of Pax Christi Netherlands 12 September 1991. Also,\\none need only read the newspaper to verify this. \\n\\nYou do realize, perhaps unknowingly -- perhaps not -- you are mirroring \\nTurkish propaganda and lies regarding what took place when and where first!\\n\\n[A] Second - in your last message you used a very terrifying\\n[A] phrase - \"Artificial borders\" when you were talking about \\n[A] Armenian. Do you believe that Armenia have righteous territorial\\n[A] claims? Do you believe that Armenia has rights to the lands that\\n[A] currently belong to other countries? \\n[A] Do you believe that this is stricktly Armenian priviledge or\\n[A] everybody should start reclaiming what once was theirs?\\n\\nI had addressed this issue several time before -- perhaps I was not clear. The\\ncurrent borders of Armenia were not set as a result of the consolidation of\\na high Armenian culture. Today\\'s Armenia is about 1/10 the land mass that\\nsustained Armenians for nearly three millennia. It was the natural Armenian\\nboundaries that sustained Armenians -- not the current boundaries. The current\\nborders of Armenia would never support a society nor sustain its growth. Does \\nthis mean that Armenia should expand? It might, if Armenia is not allowed to \\nintegrate into the region. If this past winter is any indication of the future \\nstatus of Armenia, then Armenia must do what it will to survive. \\nUnfortunately, in my opinion, and you can quote me on this, as I am sure you \\nand others will, the combined forces of both Armenia and Karabakh should have \\ntaken Karabakh and the land in between in a matter of weeks in late 1991. This \\nwould avoided all the pain and suffering both sides endured and would remove a \\ntool of Russian influence in the Caucasus. You may call me a war-monger -- so \\nbe it. If Armenians don\\'t defend their right to live on the land they live on, \\nthose rights will be taken away. The Azeris should not have the right to \\nremove these Armenians, but given the first chance to, they will, as was \\nproven throughout all of Azerbaijan. If the Soviet Union didn\\'t break apart, \\ntoday Karabakh would be emptied of Armenians. Operation Ring, started in early \\n1991 emptied the northern 1/3 of Karabakh of Armenians, but the operation was \\nsuspended by the disillusionment of the Soviet Union. Lucky for the Armenians! \\nIf the Azeris feel as though they can expel all the Armenians of Karabakh, the \\nArmenians will resist, if the Armenians can\\'t live under Azeri oppression, \\nthen they will fight for the right to live their lives free from such \\noppression. If this means these Armenian demand independence, I support such a \\nmove. If you can\\'t understand this, as an Azeri, that is truly unfortunate. \\nUntil this is understood by the Gray Wolves in Baku, more young Azeri men will \\ndie in the pursuit of the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Karabakh \\nArmenians.\\n \\n[A] Third thing - you keep saying about 3000 years of Armenian presence\\n[A] in Karabakh. What exactly you mean by that? That there were Armenians\\n[A] 3000 years ago in Karabah? Only Armenians? Or among other nations?\\n[A] I saw (SAW) a Russian tax map of Karabah with all the landowners and\\n[A] occupant names on it (the map was surveyed by Russian Army in 1810.\\n[A] Would you believe that there were almost exclusivly Achmeds and Hu-\\n[A] sseins? I also saw Armenian names, but the absolute majority of the\\n[A] population was Muslim. If I am wrong - give me your sources, but\\n[A] please, let us keep the rule that we only pay attention to third\\n[A] party sources.\\n[A] There are Russian diplomatic documents about the mission of the\\n[A] Russian famous writer and diplomat Griboedov whose mission in Iran\\n[A] was protection of Armenians that were persecuted by Persians and\\n[A] RELOCATION these Armenians inside Russian Empire. According to\\n[A] the Russian tax documents that was the time when the population of\\n[A] Karabakh became predominantly (in some places) Armenian.\\n\\nKarabakh, or Artsakh as it is known in Armenian (and Urartian) is the only\\npiece of Armenia that has a continuous Armenian occupation, from the\\ntransformation of the Urartians to Armenians, nearly 3,000 years ago. You\\nrefer to Russian and Muslim rulers over Karabakh, not the population! You\\nsurely must know the rules of Muslim landownership over non-Muslims.\\n\\n[A] You write in your letter that \"Azeris were shelling Stepanakert which\\n[A] now is almost completely destroyed\"  David - is it fair to say that \\n[A] Stepanakert was destroyed by Azeris? There is that fine line between\\n[A] propaganda and personal view, however bizzarre that view is - YOU KNOW\\n[A] AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO SAW TV IN THE TIMES OF THE EARTHQUAKE - that \\n[A] Stepanakert was almost completely devastated by the quake. \\n[A] But may be you believe that the damage from Azeri shelling is greater\\n[A] than the damage from the quake? OK, no problem, AS LONG AS YOU MENTION\\n[A] THE QUAKE. \\n\\nAs I wrote in a short response to you regarding this earlier. You may be\\nconfusing Spitak with Stepanakert. There were no effects of the earthquake \\nin Karabakh.\\n\\n[A] I want dialog. I am not interested in mud-throwing. And in dialog I want\\n[A] honest opinions (one might be wrong, but one MUST be honest). Honest \\n[A] opinions may be based on emotions but in this case one should indicate\\n[A] that. But mostly we are looking for information based opinions.\\n[A] I always ask myself - why I think that? Is it because I was told so\\n[A] bt so many people that it became a truth? Or I read a book? Who wrote\\n[A] it? What was his/her intentions/interests/whatever? \\n\\nFine. I stated my opinions and the reasons for them. If you put into action \\nwhat you just stated above, you would understand my outrage at the posting of \\nFarid who just posted items from some Islamic conference, etc., and just left \\nit at that. He has done his numerous times. At least I responded to that \\nposting, and was outraged that Farid simply copies other people`s text, posts \\nit -- yet does not display the courage be responsible for what he posts. One \\ncan always stand behind the facade of claiming what I write is polemic, \\nhowever, as a result such irresponsibility I am free to make a claim of \\ncowardice. \\n\\n[A] Please, give me sources, facts, titles of the books of third party\\n[A] writers, etc.\\n\\nI believe I have, and can support what I claim. I don\\'t make up history, nor\\ndo I have to! I have done enough research regarding Turkish Genocide Apology \\nto revisionism from good scholarship, and I will never fall victim to \\nbottomless pit of making claims without a solid basis.\\n\\n[A] And please, answer my questions in the beginning of the letter.\\n\\n[A] And for you Armenian friends who do not like what I write - \\n[A] sorry, but these are my thoughts and it is very disturbing\\n[A] that you like people when they say what you like and dislike\\n[A] them when they say something that you do not like. \\n\\nAlex, I stated my friends and associates where rather surprised as the tone of\\nyour posting considering the fact that I had categorized you as an open-minded \\nAzeri. Perhaps I was fooled by you? Perhaps I should believe that you are like \\n\"all Azeris when it comes to Armenians\". I chose not to accept such a \\nstatement. They were not surprised at what you said so much as it was coming \\nfrom you, somebody from which they expected otherwise. You see, you didn\\'t add \\nanything to the issue, which was the expectation, only conforming old\\nsuspicions.\\n\\n[A] For me\\n[A] it is most inportant that a guy makes a honest effort to find\\n[A] the truth. If so, he/she might have whatever opinion he/she\\n[A] wants. I believe that telling people the truth, seeking it - is \\n[A] far more noble than just support your race because it is yours.\\n[A] That is a way of animals, primitive tribes and criminal societies.\\n[A] Civilized people seek truth.\\n\\n[A] Cheers,\\n\\n[A] Alex\\n\\nIf you think I am intellectually dishonest, please demonstrate it. As I stated\\nabove, I am partisan on this issue, thus expect me to take a stand in the\\ninterest of the Armenians, not against Armenians. This stance should not seem \\nstrange to you. I am not here to generate excuses for Armenians wanting to \\nlive on the land they live on, and wanting to live in peace. If Armenians must \\ndie for what they believe in, and make ultimate sacrifice, you had better \\nlisten to them. No amount of rhetoric -- not from Yerevan, Baku, the CSCE, nor \\npaid prostitutes in Washington -- will convince Karabakh Armenians otherwise! \\n\\n\\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\\nS.D.P.A.

ID cards have a field of nationality\\nwhich is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly, this field\\nis provided for sevices provided by the religious departments\\nof the gov\\'t, though this is not the general case.\\n\\n|> 2.

As such, the Israeli gov\\'t has always felt that defining\\nits borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have\\nbeen conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for \"ultimate borders\"\\n(is this a game like \"ultimate frisbee\"?) extending into  other countries.\\n\\n|> 3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ?

Questions of the sort \"Is it true that you entered your\\nmother\\'s vagina?\" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though\\nphrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions\\nupon Israel.

The Eastern mountain ridge should be\\nabandonded.  This is where most of the arabs live and it is less\\nmilitarily relevant.  Israel should also maintain a presence in the\\nJordan valley.\\n\\n>If so (for those of you who support it), why were so\\n>many settlers moved into the territories?  If it is not temporary,\\n>let\\'s hear it.\\n\\n\\tThere are a number of reasons for people to move (they were\\nnot moved, but chose to move) into disputed areas.  Note that since\\nthese moves were made by free willed human beings, not \"settlers,\" I\\nwill address two aspects of your question, why the government would\\nallow &/or encourage them to move, and second why they did move.\\n\\n\\tThe government had a number of reasons for encouraging people\\nto move across the green line.  They included security and politics.\\n\\n\\tThe first reason was security.  A large Jewish presense makes\\nit difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  A Jewish settlements also\\nact as fortresses in times of war.\\n\\n\\tA second reason was political.  Creating \"settlements\" brought\\nthe arabs to the negotiation table.  Had the creation of new towns and\\ncities gone on another several years, there would be no place left in\\nIsrael where there was an arab majority.  There would have been no\\nland left that could be called arab.\\n\\n\\tThe fact that there are a hundered thousands Jews in place\\nchanges the face of any peace settlement, and restricts what land can\\nbe given away.\\n\\n\\tIndividuals who crossed the green line had several reasons for\\ndoing so.  They include financial, religious, and political reasons.\\n\\n\\tMany of the communities created were \"bedroom\" communities.\\nSuburbs.  A house 20 minutes outside of Tel Aviv cost half less if it\\nwas on the wrong side of the green line.  People who moved there\\nwanted a decent home at a nice price.\\n\\n\\tSome of the communites created were religious.  They built\\ntheir neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of\\nthe 30\\'s and 40\\'s.  There are communities like this in Hebron, Gaza,\\nand all over.  There are also communities built near religious sites.\\n\\n\\tThe last reason people moved was to establish a political\\nJewish presense outside the green line.  They built communities to\\ncontrol important intersections, important hilltops, roads, and other\\nplaces.\\n\\n\\tThe point is, there are many reasons people moved over the\\ngreen line, and many reasons the government wanted them to.  Whatever\\nstatus is negotiated for disputed territories, it will not be an \"all\\nor nothing\" deal.  New boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation, not\\nbe the results of a war.\\n\\nAdam\\n\\nAdam Shostack \\t\\t\\t\\t       adam@das.harvard.edu\\n\\n\"If we had a budget big enough for drugs and sexual favors, we sure\\nwouldn\\'t waste them on members of Congress...\"   -John Perry Barlow\\n'),\n",

I knew him to be Turkey\\'s man; due to my\\n  reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him, I was a member\\n  of the promotion committee. For that case, I sat down and read his entire\\n  treatise \"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey\". It took me\\n  three months and I found out, from volume I, that he had plagiarized \\n  Uzun Jarsoglu, an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history. Shaw\\n  himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome \\n  of a 20-year search through the Ottoman Archives. Well, I went on leave  \\n  and managed to show 40% of Volume I, containing around 5000 sentences, \\n  to be the result of plagiarism, matching each sentence with passages    \\n  from the original work. He had even reproduced the errors. So I produced a\\n  500-pages manuscript and submitted a 60-pages report on Shaw\\'s plagiarism. \\n\\n  The University, however, rejected my report and, after a closed meeting,\\n  promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor. I paid a price for \\n  all this: upset by the whole process, I confronted the entire University\\n  structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman. I asked for\\n  permission to run a seminar on Shaw\\'s book that was denied by the President\\n  of the University. While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me\\n  permission, the President was depriving me of my academic freedom. Luckily,\\n  the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar, attended by more \\n  than 150 academic people, in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw, who refused\\n  to attend.

Igor and I had thought that if it was \\na girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy, \\nwe\\'d call him Arsen, after Igor\\'s grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without\\nIgor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.\\n\\nOur family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew \\nup together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16. \\nIn 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in \\nSumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son,\\nSeryozha, is four and a half.\\n\\nFirst I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from \\nwork I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were \\nKomsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children\\'s organization], and there were \\nboth Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were \\nshouting, \"There\\'s no room for Christians here!\" and \"When we finish with the \\nArmenians, we\\'ll go after the Russians!\" And some even cried Out, \"Death to \\nthe Armenians!\" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became \\nfrightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen \\ndowntown. My family couldn\\'t believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich \\nMelkumian, wasn\\'t home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o\\'clock he \\nreturned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was \\nsmashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I \\nwas telling him everything, too, and he said, \"What, is there no longer any\\ngovernment?\" That same day Igor said, \"Papa, something terrible is happening \\nin the city.\" And he said, \"We\\'ll stay at home, no one will drive us from our \\nown home.\"\\n\\nThe day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn\\'t go out. We called \\nour relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the \\nsame thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an \\nArmenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law\\'s wife, and I \\ncalled the police: they\\'re wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and \\nnonetheless they didn\\'t come and they didn\\'t do anything.\\n\\nOn February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were \\nafraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I \\ntold the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn\\'t \\nbe coming in. He agreed, and even said, \"Fine, don\\'t come in, we understand \\nwhat\\'s going on in town, don\\'t come in.\"\\n\\nBefore that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my \\nfather-in-law and said, \"Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are \\nhappening in town.\" Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, \"With my own eyes I \\nsaw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don\\'t know,\" he said, \"we \\nshould leave town.\" Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we \\nshould go, thinking we\\'d go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, \\nclothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the \\nbuilding manager came by and said, \"Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is \\nbad, don\\'t go out.\" My father even opened up to him and said, \"Maybe we\\'ll \\ndrive to the dacha, it\\'ll be safer there.\" \"No,\" he said, \"it\\'ll be worse \\nthere, you\\'ll be safer at home.\" He said don\\'t be afraid, if something happens \\nI\\'ll send people to save you.\\n\\nAfter he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our \\ncourtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two \\nchildren, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my \\nmother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of \\nthem, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started\\nbreaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, \"Go in that room\\nand close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won\\'t hear\\nthat there\\'s anyone home.\" The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my \\nbrother-in-law\\'s wife, suggested, \"Let\\'s run out onto the balcony.\" We -- the\\ntwo daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out\\nonto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, \\n\"Quick, over to the other balcony, or they\\'ll kill you all.\" We lived on the\\nsecond floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor\\'s. At\\nfirst we couldn\\'t manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time\\npeople were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I \\npleaded and begged: \"Please, call someone, have someone come!\" I even started \\nshouting. \"I\\'ll throw down the children, I\\'ll throw them down, you catch them \\nand take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive.\" Either they \\nwere afraid or . . . I don\\'t know what. They looked as though they were \\nwatching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I\\'ll say it \\nagain, these weren\\'t the bandits, these were people from the other part of the \\nbuilding and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A \\nbus even stopped. I remember a man\\'s voice saying the Armenians were climbing\\nover to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children \\nover there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn\\'t yet \\nseven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; \\nyou know, I just don\\'t remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, \\nand Edik\\'s wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and \\ncrying. My Kristina said, \"Mamma, don\\'t throw us over the balcony, we\\'re \\nafraid!\" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina \\ndidn\\'t even want to climb over. She shouted, \"I\\'m staying with Grandmother,\\nI\\'m staying with Grandma!\" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And \\nmy mother-in-law shouted, \"Oh no, Kristina\\'s still there, she\\'s still there, \\nsave Kristina, too!\" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira \\nhelped us and went back inside.\\n\\nWe started pounding on the neighbor\\'s balcony door. I pounded with my fist, \\nSevil, open the door, open it, please!\" She didn\\'t open it. \"No, go away, go \\nanywhere, go, I\\'m not opening the door.\" She was our neighbor, we were \\nfriends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we \\nwere going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and \\nsaid, \"Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don\\'t stay here, they\\'ll \\nkill us, too, because of you.\" I begged, \"Please, at least take the children, \\nwe\\'ll leave, we\\'ll go back.\" \"No,\" she said, \"you have to leave.\" Her sons ran \\nin, one had a knife. Sevil\\'s brother, he\\'s around 18, shouted at us: \"Get out \\nof here, leave, I\\'ll kill you with this knife!\" I became terrified, I took the \\nchildren and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down \\nand heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard \"The Armenians must be \\nkilled, they\\'ve taken all the best places, all the best apartments!\" One of \\nthem said, \"Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!\" When I \\nheard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their \\ndoor for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn\\'t see Zhasmen any \\nlonger. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, \\nthat they would save her.\\n\\nMy head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next \\nentryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a \\nhalf. They were crying, \"Mamma, we\\'re scared!\" They were so frightened that I \\ndidn\\'t even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was \\nawful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, \"Open up, let \\nme inside!\" He opened the door slightly and said, \"No!\" \"No\" and that was it! \\nHe said it so sternly: \"No!\" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists \\non the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood \\nthere, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get \\ndown on my knees. \"Please, I beg of you, at least take the children.\" He \\nwasn\\'t an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don\\'t even know how, but he let me \\ninside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn\\'t \\npassed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn\\'t want \\nto open the door. And again I started pleading, \"Please, open the door, it\\'s \\nour Ira and Lilia! Open the door!\" And he said, \"No, I\\'m afraid.\" I said again \\nand again, \"Please, open the door, please!\" He looked at me. He looked at me \\nfor a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We \\nthrew ourselves into each other\\'s arms, crying. Then the man locked us into \\nthe bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, \"Calm \\nthe children, and calm yourselves down, too.\"\\n\\nCalm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in \\nour apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I \\nsaid, \"Igor, Edik, let\\'s say farewell.\" And Edik turned around and looked at \\nme as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would \\nkill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They \\nstarted pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that \\nhe had told us, \"Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight.\" He thought we \\nwere in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: \\n\"Edik, Igor, let\\'s say farewell.\" Igor didn\\'t think we could climb over to the \\nother balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can\\'t believe we were \\nable to save ourselves.\\n\\nIgor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All \\nthe men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next \\nto the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from \\nthe other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: \"Open the door!\" We \\nwere all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, \"They\\'re home,\\nthey\\'re in there, break down the door!\" And I remember my father-in-law \\nwhispering, \"They\\'re going to break it down now, it\\'s coming down now . . . \"\\n\\nHe had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were \\ngoing to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal \\nchair legs. From outside the door they said, \"We\\'re counting to five, open \\nup!\" But we were all quiet, we didn\\'t answer them. We made like no one was \\nhome. We figured they\\'d leave, they\\'d get tired and leave. My father-in-law \\nhad said, \"It\\'s not possible they\\'d come into my home. How can that be? \\nEveryone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with \\neveryone.\" And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn\\'t an Azerbaijani \\nguest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there \\noften, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save \\nourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, \"I\\'m not \\nleaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I\\'m going to fight \\nalongside them.\" That\\'s just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, \\n\"If they open the door and come into the apartment then I\\'m going to fight \\nalongside my family, I\\'m not going anywhere.\"\\n\\nWe were at Sevil\\'s when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and \\nshouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor \\nat the Lezgin\\'s apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira\\'s \\nvoice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a \\nlong time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: \"Open the \\ndoor, what are they doing to Ira, who\\'s shouting, that\\'s Ira shouting, that\\'s \\nher voice!\" But the Lezgin said, \"It\\'s nothing, calm down, no, it\\'s not in \\nyour apartment.\" He was lying to me so I\\'d calm down. Two hours went by and \\nthe Lezgin opened the door and said, \"Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran \\naway.\" He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him \\noutside, next to the building.\\n\\nWhile we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The \\nway Ira shouted! She shouted, \"Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!\" \\nShe repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many \\npeople there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, \\nwhistling--you just can\\'t imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.\\n\\nApparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway \\nwhere we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I \\ndon\\'t know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in\\nparticular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed \\nover the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law \\nwere climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming \\nup the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were \\nour last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. \\nThey were sleeping. I woke them up: \"Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!\" And I tell \\nIra: \"Ira, if something happens, we\\'ll throw ourselves off the balcony.\" We \\nwere on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door \\ntoo, because later he said, \"I opened the door and told them there were no \\nArmenians inside.\" And after they all left our neighbor went out on the \\nbalcony himself to see: they were gone.\\n\\nWe weren\\'t friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from \\nthe building. But the people we were friends with wouldn\\'t even consider \\nhiding us.\\n\\nThe Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, \\n\"Karina, there\\'re no lights on in our block.\" The whole block was dark, the \\nwhole block! It\\'s a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, \"I\\'m afraid to keep\\nyou until morning, I\\'m afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving\\nyou.\" I said, \"What are you saying, we\\'ll leave now. But we can\\'t just leave\\nwith the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere\\nelse to hide.\" He said, \"Well OK, go look.\" I asked Ira, \"Ira, do you want to\\ngo?\" Ira said, \"No, I\\'ll stay with the children, Karina.\" I said, \"Fine, then\\nI\\'ll go.\" Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one \\nwas in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at \\nafter seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never \\nwent out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a\\nslaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the \\nboarding school and my director answered. He said, \"Karina, where are you?\" I\\ndidn\\'t know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn\\'t know where I \\nwas. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what \\ntime it was, I asked him, \"What time is it?\" He said 11:20, I think, but I \\ndon\\'t really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I \\nlook and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there\\nwas the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse \\nfor a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen \\ngrabbed my hand and squeezed it: \"Hurry up, let\\'s go . . . Hurry up, come on, \\nwhat are you turning around for?\" I turned around and saw a large truck, it \\nmust have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck \\nlike that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the \\nfourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police \\nthen they\\'ll put me away. I couldn\\'t count on them. Before I reached the \\npolice station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, \"Soldier, in \\nBlock 41, I don\\'t know if they\\'ve killed people or injured them--we need to \\nsave them!\" And he said, \"Go to the police station and tell them everything.\" \\nI said, \"I\\'m afraid to go there, I\\'m afraid of them.\" He said, \"Don\\'t be \\nafraid.\"\\n\\nWe went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military \\nvehicle went to our building. I didn\\'t go with them, they left me at the \\npolice station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that \\nthey\\'d rescue them, too. I didn\\'t know where they were or what had happened to\\nthem.\\n\\nAfter a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us \\nto the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they \\ntook us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, \\nvery many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was \\nonly wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, \\nnothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.\\n\\nThe Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably \\nalive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of \\nSumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came \\nand told us, \"Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party \\nCommittee.\" My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for \\nsix days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee \\nand waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira \\nhad only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went \\nby. And then one of the functionaries told us, \"Karina, Ira, gather your \\ncourage. Would you like to go to the burial?\" I said, \"What, did they really \\nkill all of them?!\" He said, \"Let\\'s look.\" He had a long list, and he started \\nreading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-\\nlaw, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,\\nand Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, \\n\"Get in the car, let\\'s go to the burial.\"\\n\\nWe buried our family. I couldn\\'t believe it at the time, I couldn\\'t conceive\\nof it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my \\nchildren when they\\'re older?\\n\\nMy children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and\\ngrandmother. Kristina didn\\'t love me the way she loved her grandfather and\\ngrandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, \"My grandma is \\nbetter than anyone!\" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it\\'s \\ndifficult for her, and once she told her: \"You\\'re a bad grandmother.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know why, I asked her, \"Kristina, where\\'s Papa?\" and she said, \"They \\nkilled him.\" She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded\\nSeryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, \"When Papa \\ncomes I\\'m going to tell him everything!\"\\n\\nJuly 26, 1988\\nNairi Boarding House\\nNear the Village of Arzakan\\nHrazdan District\\nArmenian SSR\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Allegations of Jewish\\ndisrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are\\none of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and\\nrumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms\\nthan blood libel. The stereotypes that pervade our culture create\\ncognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. Therefore any\\nclaim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by\\ndecent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.\\nIf such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has\\nnot been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should be\\ngiven the first time it appears.  Now that the claim has been\\ndocumented, I regard the whole episode as disgusting and\\nshameful.

The attempts to quiet any violence\\n    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder\\n    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and\\n    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move\\n    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts\\n    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find \\n    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than\\n    anti-Israel bigotry.\\n\\n\\n>The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population\\n>density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.\\n>The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of\\n>Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the\\n>strip and seek work in Israel.\\n\\n    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by\\n    residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to\\n    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of\\n    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a\\n    racist ommission on your part.\\n\\n\\n>While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the\\n>Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help\\n>the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli\\n>Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.\\n>\\n>The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is\\n>recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of\\n>justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to\\n>rise up against its tormentors.\\n\\n    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is\\n    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have\\n    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave\\n    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the\\n    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing\\n    but an anti-Israel charade.\\n\\n\\n>As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of\\n>Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are\\n>considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops\\n>and fields. \\n\\n    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli\\n    citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials\\n    taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your\\n    stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan\\n    residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as\\n    collaborators.\\n\\n\\n\\t     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in\\n>Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for\\n>the Master Race.\\n\\n    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you\\n    attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of\\n    your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the\\n    racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have   \\n    the same bigoted makeup as you?  \\n    \\n    Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master \\n    race,' for you to avoid...\\n\\n    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to\\n    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to\\n    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the\\n    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,\\n    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\\n    in Lebanon.  \\n\\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of\\n    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just\\n    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney\\n    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an\\n    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort\\n    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to\\n    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons\\n    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard\\n    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich \\n    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight \\n    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or\\n    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT\\n    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is\\n    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.\\n\\n\\n>The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the\\n>right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the\\n>occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some\\n>Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over\\n>Gaza through Arab collaborators.\\n\\n    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your\\n    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a\\n    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or\\n    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take\\n    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do\\n    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is\\n    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a \\n    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You\\n    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of \\n    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single\\n    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it\\n    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most\\n    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it\\n    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast\\n    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic\\n    manner.\\n\\n\\n>As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible\\n>with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming\\n>Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for\\n>self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish\\n>society does not consider Gazans full human beings. \\n\\n    And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is\\n    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had\\n    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land\\n    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS\\n    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a \\n    completely different set of international laws?  Since you do\\n    continuously refer to international law, would you please say\\n    what specific international laws Israel is violating?  \\n    \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   This attitude\\n>is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. \\n\\n    I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.\\n\\n\\n>                                                             The\\n>current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are\\n>consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister\\n>Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. \\n\\n    Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he\\n    wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll\\n    have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort\\n    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.\\n\\n\\n>                                           One is led to ask\\n>oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister\\n>goals towards the Gazans ?

Do you have an\\n    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,\\n    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what\\n    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the\\n    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims \\n    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death\\n    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk\\n    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel\\n    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to \\n    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The\\n    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being\\n    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.\\n    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept\\n    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.\\n    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the\\n    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your \\n    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    \\n\\n    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual\\n    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself\\n    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the\\n    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your\\n    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe\\n    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born\\n    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is\\n    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a\\n    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these\\n    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your \\n    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, \\n    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to \\n    appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other \\n    people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do \\n    some good.\\n \\n    But for now, you are a fruad.\\n\\n\\n \\n\"),\n",

But\\nI strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\\nin fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\\nthemselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\\nrelations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is \\nanything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.\\n\\nTo say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply\\nthey are not separate peoples.  The events of the past two years\\nclearly show Muslim determination to remain separate: in their alliance\\nwith Croats, they maintained this separation.  Croats would have\\naccepted a much closer relationship, I think.  This century plus\\nof building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at\\nrisk, because of the inexorable logic of war.  \\n\\nSince Bosnian Serbs (32% of population) have 10 times more heavy\\nweapons than Bosnian Muslims (44%) and Croats (17%) combined, they\\nhave squeezed Muslims and Croats into only 30% of the territory.\\nMuslims lost more territory than Croats (who built defenses early on).\\n\\nUnder these conditions, any alliance is bound to fall apart since\\nit is easier to recover lost land from Croats than from Serbs.\\nThe only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of\\nfortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the\\narms embargo.  Since Warren Christopher had no luck persuading\\nthe Europeans to go along with this, this hope was dashed.  Having\\nno prospect of outside help, the former allies turned on each other,\\nlike two starved animals in a tight cage.\\n\\nThis inexorable logic, of course, got plenty of help from Serbian\\nintelligence operatives, who were doing everything to build\\nmistrust between Croats and Muslims for over a year.  A timely\\nintervention to stop Serbian aggression would have prevented this.\\n\\nSadly, nothing was done to create a balance of power on the\\nground.  As long as the Serbs enjoy 10:1 advantage, they can \\nbreak any alliance, even among friends.  This is tragic, but\\nhardly new: \"divide et impera\" was used by ancient Romans\\nwith success.  In my view, Bosnian Muslims and Croats managed\\nto resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until May 9, 1993,\\nwhen the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost.  \\n\\nI have a question for the distinguished diplomats: do they\\nbelieve Balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder?  I\\'d like to know\\nwhat did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which\\nsolidified Serbian 10:1 advantage in heavy weapons; how did they expect\\nto prevent fragmentation of the Muslim and Croat defense forces;  and how\\non Earth do they hope to restore peace without justice?\\n\\nThe implications of this immoral approach I cannot begin to predict,\\nbut I am filled with foreboding...\\n\\nSincerely,\\nJosip\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with\\na bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back\\ninto the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so\\nthey could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens \\nbecause they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn\\'t leave.

The success of the Greek national movement,\\n  provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the\\n  efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the\\n  other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so\\n  much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which\\n  dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious\\n  independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the\\n  Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent\\n  aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>>\\n\\n  page 188:\\n\\n  <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their\\n   campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular\\n   representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian\\n   missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and\\n   hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as\\n   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.\\n\\n   Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity,\\n   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews\\n   and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.\\n   Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving\\n   large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies,\\n   by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects\\n   who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim\\n   support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent\\n   nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive\\n   and damaging.\\n\\n   The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting\\n   nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian\\n   states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout\\n   the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary\\n   in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>\\n\\n  page 188:\\n\\n  <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,\\n   their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and\\n   massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking\\n   boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which\\n   had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries\\n   earlier.\\n\\n   This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth\\n   century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united\\n   Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth\\n   century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its\\n   Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When\\n   Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian\\n   principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre\\n   of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>\\n\\n  page 189:\\n\\n  <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the\\n  Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from\\n  Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and\\n  plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through\\n  Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>>\\n\\n  page 190 (second paragraph):\\n\\n  <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population\\n   was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal\\n   property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews\\n   who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to\\n   compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>>\\n\\n  page 190 (third paragraph):\\n\\n  <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly\\n   because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist\\n   movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia\\n   during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by\\n   the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During\\n   the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred\\n   in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about\\n   twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were\\n   massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,\\n   after describing the carnage, concluded \\'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled\\n   with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac\\n   and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the\\n   Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the\\n   city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial\\n   superior to that of an ass.\\' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of\\n   Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of\\n   Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].\\n   The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled\\n   from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity\\n   under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into\\n   rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before\\n   it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression\\n   and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities\\n   to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years\\n   of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the\\n   mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the\\n   Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately\\n   fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary\\n   accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying\\n   exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of\\n   the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats\\n   to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman\\n   Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,\\n   particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the\\n   Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their\\n   populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th\\n   century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews\\n   who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu\\n   and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands\\n   more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and\\n   Izmir [21].>>\\n\\n   page 193 (last paragraph):\\n\\n   <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing\\n   protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe\\n   stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all\\n   the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being\\n   used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as\\n   for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and\\n   professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian\\n   millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,\\n   Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the\\n   Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally\\n   atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their\\n   homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors\\n   fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements\\n   subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done\\n   in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the\\n   twentieth century.>>\\n\\n  page 194 (last paragraph):\\n\\n  <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the\\n   Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the\\n   Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due\\n   to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of\\n   those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a\\n   popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of\\n   the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,\\n   thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms\\n   in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods\\n   of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from\\n   persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.\\n\\n   The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian\\n   forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,\\n   and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,\\n   homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus\\n   toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically\\n   described the situation caused by the invading armies:\\n\\n      \\'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,\\n      all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never\\n      destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the\\n      entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can\\n      never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the\\n      damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done\\n      to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government\\n      weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors\\n      inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The\\n      consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of\\n      them were massacred in a single night....\\'[28]\\n\\n     \\'It wasn\\'t only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and\\n      burned.

But the government announced strict security measures\\nand began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of\\nLezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.\\n\\nVisitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon\\nafter the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.\\n\\nAt the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to\\ndiscuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a\\nwar they say is not theirs.\\n\\n\"I have been drafted, but I won\\'t go,\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth\\nglinting in the sun. \"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have\\nnothing to do with Armenia.\"\\n\\nMore than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed\\nterritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.\\n\\nMalik Kerimov, an official in the mayor\\'s office, said only 11 of 300 locals\\ndrafted in 1992 had served.\\n\\n\"The police don\\'t force people to go,\" he said. \"They are afraid of an\\nuprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\"\\n\\nAll the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but\\ndisagreed on how the protest came about.\\n\\nSome said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was\\nabout to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.\\n\\nOthers said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the\\nLezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.\\n\\n\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about\\ndraft orders,\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.\\n\\n\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis, \\nthe Russians.\"\\n\\nIn the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,\\nin what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep\\nover the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.\\n\\nBy 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they\\ncame under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the \\n600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.\\n\\nAbout half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.\\n\\n\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\" complained Mais\\nTalibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,\\nincluded brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.\\n\\n\"We want our own country,\" he said. \"We want to be able to move about easily.\\nBut Baku won\\'t listen to us.\"\\n\\nPhysically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other\\nAzerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same \\njobs and intermarrying to some degree.\\n\\nBut the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and\\nPersian with strong guttural vowels.\\n\\nAzerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest\\nethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary \\nschool classes in their language.\\n\\nAutonomy is a different question.

NOT !!\\n\\n\\tI will believe it when I see it.\\n\\n\\tNow, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing\\n        to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?\\n\\tDo you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the\\n\\tBARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean\\n\\tBURNING people ALIVE !\\n\\nBM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the \\nBM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that \\nBM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's \\nBM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  \\n\\n\\tArmenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are \\n        NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY \\n\\tfrom them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. \\n\\nBM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent \\nBM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe \\nBM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better \\nBM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\\n\\n\\tDon't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the\\n\\tconflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in\\n\\tKARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.\\n\\nBM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\\nBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of \\nBM] their blood and future. \\n\\n\\tAgain, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension\\n        to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH\\n        are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.\\n\\nBM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \\nBM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\\nBM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \\nBM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\\nBM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for\\nBM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading\\nBM] inflammatory half-truths.\\n\\n\\tIt is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely\\n        for it. But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself,\\n        you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of\\n\\tThe Armenian Massacres.\\n\"),\n",

Translation of Ha\\'aretz article.\\n\\nRacism in the Knesset\\n---------------------\\n\\nCoalition requirements on one hand, and the presence of progressive MKs\\nfrom _Meretz_ in the coalition on the other, have compelled Rabin and\\nhis friends to change, to some extent, their attitude towards the Arab\\npublic and their representatives in the Knesset.  Although he did refuse\\nto view them as partners, taking part in the coalition and joining the\\ngovernment, he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document\\nof intentions which included a commitment to \"work towards a decrease in\\nthe discrimination between Jewish and Arab citizens\".  [Decrease WHAT?!?!\\nBut posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does\\nnot exist *at* *all*!  Is Rabin, too, a closet self-hater??? - Yigal].\\n\\nHowever, racism has not disappeared.  When the Knesset sat to consider\\nwho would staff its various committees, a request was made to put an MK\\nfrom Hadash [the Communist party, one of the \"Arab\" parties - Yigal] on\\nthe State Comptroller\\'s Committee.  And oh, did that ever stir up a\\nstorm -- including in the ranks of Labor -- since many Knesset members\\nfind it unthinkable that an Arab MK sit on one of the important house\\ncommittees.  \"Security secrets\" are liable to fall into their hands...\\n\\nThis attitude -- which until recently had not even aroused criticism,\\nbeing so natural and so deeply-embossed upon people\\'s hearts -- holds\\nthat there are Knesset members who, despite having been elected by tens\\nof thousands of votes, are not entitled to be full partners in the body\\nwhich represents the people of Israel.  We are not speaking here of\\npolitical discrimination -- which would be bad enough in itself -- but\\nof racial discrimination.  The proof: one of the compromises proposed\\nwas that MK Mahamid [an Arab - Yigal] should be replaced by Tamar\\nGojanski [a Jew - Yigal] from the same party.  It was not the member\\'s\\nparty which was considered unfit, but his race...\\n\\n[* Here is a documented case in a respected Israeli newspaper. *]\\n\\nIt is worth noting that for the first time since the state\\'s founding, a\\npublic debate has arisen on this subject, as witness the following\\narticle:\\n\\n\\nA TEST OF SELF-CONFIDENCE\\n\\nBy Gid\\'on Levi, Ha\\'aretz, July 26, 1992\\n\\nRevelations of discrimination against Arabs have become such an integral\\npart of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal\\nwith them.  [Do you hear that, -----?  Please contact this Levi fellow\\nand explain to him how little he knows about Israel.  Please! - Yigal].\\nExcept that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government\\'s\\nwindow dressing, and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious.\\n\\nLast week provided two more such examples: the Israeli Knesset is\\nfinding it very difficult to allow Arab representation on its more\\nimportant committees; and Israel Television is finding it no less\\ndifficult to give a platform to Arabs from the territories.  Seemingly\\ntwo entirely different matters, but in fact they are one and the same.\\n\\nThe 13th Knesset proved last week that, even though one third of its\\nmembers are new faces, it has not renewed its own face at all, at least\\non one issue.  Parliamentary traditions may be modernized and\\nparliamentary traditions may become obsolete, and only one tradition\\nendures forever: no Arab shall set foot in the more important committees\\nof the house.  There has never been and never will be an Arab MK on the\\nExternal Affairs and Defense Committee or on the Finance Committee.\\nWorlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not \"to\\ngive\" Arabs, for the first time, a place on the State Comptroller\\'s\\nCommittee.\\n\\nThe arguments are old and well-known: In all three of the above\\ncommittees innumerable secrets are revealed -- and woe unto us if an\\nArab should hear them.  One must not make light of such arguments, but\\ntheir significance should also not be exaggerated.  Every Arab MK is not\\nspending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over\\ninformation from the Knesset committee room to Black Panther\\nheadquarters in Jenin; and not all the aforementioned committees are\\ncontinually occupied in the discussion of top-secret matters, which\\ncould safely be revealed, for example, to MKs supportive of the Jewish\\nUnderground, but not to an Arab MK from the Likud, Labor, or even from\\nHadash.\\n\\nThe Arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the Subcommittee\\non Secret Service Matters, but what would happen, one may ask, if MK\\nNawaf Masalha were to hear, God forbid, a review of the Foreign Minister\\nin an open meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, or even\\na review of the Army Chief of Staff which, in any case, are regularly\\nleaked to the next edition of the news.  And what would happen if MK\\nHashem Mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at\\nal-Najah?\\n\\nTheir non-participation [in important committees] and that of their\\ncolleagues, creates an intolerable situation, where Arab members of the\\nelected house have only semi-positions.  They are good enough for\\naddressing plenary sessions, and for voting for or against the\\ngovernment and participating in the deliberations of the Immigration and\\nAbsorption Committee.  But they must not, for example, participate in\\nthe process of formulating the state budget in the Finance Committee or\\nin the allocation of resources to local authorities.  In any case, they\\nhave little part in that.\\n\\nLabor\\'s dependence on the support of the Arab parties has brought about\\nsome improvement: MK Hashem Mahamid, will, it seems, participate in the\\nState Comptroller\\'s Committee.  Earlier, there had been a ridiculous\\nattempt made to dictate to Hadash who their representative should be,\\nand thus to prevent the Arab from entering this dubious holy-of-holies,\\nbut it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional\\nbacking for such a step.\\n\\nBut not to worry: even now the Jewish mind is contriving devices.  The\\nnew Committee Chair, Roni Milo, has already announced that he will set up\\nsubcommittees aplenty for his committee.  Thus he will decide where it\\nis permissible for Mahamid to participate and where not.  A solution\\nsuch as this could, by the way, also have been adopted for the rest of\\nthe committees, thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets\\nbeing leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from\\nthe Knesset.\\n\\n[. . .]\\n\\nEnd Article\\n\\nDo you accept that as documentation?\\n\\nJoseph Askew\\n\\n-- \\nJoseph Askew, Gauche and Proud  In the autumn stillness, see the Pleiades,\\njaskew@spam.maths.adelaide.edu  Remote in thorny deserts, fell the grief.\\nDisclaimer?

Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as \\nthey ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \\njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \\nof the hills.\\n\\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \\nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \\nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \\nor missing... \\n\\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \\nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \\nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \\nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \\nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \\nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\\n\\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \\nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \\nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \\nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \\nrepeated blasts.\\n\\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \\nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \\nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \\nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \\nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \\nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \\n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \\nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\\n\\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \\nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \\nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \\ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\\'s job was to land in the mountains \\nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \\nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\\n\\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \\narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \\nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \\nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \\nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \\nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \\npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\\n\\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \\nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \\nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \\ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \\nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \\non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \\ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \\nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\\n\\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \\ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \\ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \\nmortis. They had been shot.\\n\\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \\nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh?

The estimated population\\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\\n of Transcaucasia\\'s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \\n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4.

Our troops surrounded village after village. \\n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \\n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \\n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \\n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \\n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \\n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \\n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \\n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \\n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \\n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \\n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \\n scattered bones of the dead.\" \\n\\n                             Ohanus Appressian\\n                            \"Men Are Like That\"\\n                                   p. 202.\\n\\n\\n SOME OF THE REFERENCES FROM EMINENT AUTHORS IN THE FIELD OF MIDDLE-EASTERN\\n HISTORY AND EYEWITNESSES OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE OF 2.5 MILLION MUSLIMS\\n\\n1. \"The Armenian Revolutionary Movement\" by Louise Nalbandian,\\n   University of California Press, Berkeley, Los Angeles, 1975\\n\\n2. \"Diplomacy of Imperialism 1890-1902\" by William I.

Just a simple question.\\n\\n...with a simple answer!\\n\\n[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox\\n[EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is\\n[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism\\n[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian\\nApostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians \\nin Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.  \\n\\n[EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia\\n[EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.\\n\\nThis is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in\\ncertain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,\\nTurks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all\\nArmenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger \\nsociety.\\n\\n[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what\\n[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian\\n[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion\\n[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn\\'t even speak\\n[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the\\n[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian \\n[EE] consciousness.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless\\nof the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian\\nnationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later \\nstages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to \\nIslam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This \\npractice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy \\nof clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these\\nconverted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. \\n\\n[EE] Any information will be appreciated.\\n\\nYou answered your own question!

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\\n\\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \\n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\\n\\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\\n and dirt...\\n\\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \\n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\\n\\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\\n\\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\\n\\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \\n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \\n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\\n \\'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.\\' Thus ten\\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\\n\\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\\n\\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \\n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \\n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\\n hatred and loathing.\\n\\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\\n\\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\\n\\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \\n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\\n children and old people. The women\\'s bodies had obvious marks of\\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\\n\\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \\n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel\\'s\\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\\n\\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\\n\\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\\n out the women\\'s heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \\n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \\n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \\n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\\n on the streets.\\n\\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\\n murdering an innocent Turk. \\n\\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \\n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: \\'How dare\\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?\\' In Erzurum, the \\n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \\n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\\n act. However no result was achieved.\\n\\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \\n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \\n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \\n\\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: \\'You are Russians.\\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.\\' The Armenians had a\\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\\n of the Turkish soldiers.\\n\\n The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real\\n nature of the Armenian ideology.

During the course of evening I asked \\n Ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and \\n the cause of its destruction. In his matter of fact way he replied, Yes, \\n I assisted in its sack and destruction, and witnessed the slaying of \\n those whose bones you saw to-day scattered among its ruins.\" \\n\\np. 202 (first and second paragraphs).\\n\\n\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \\n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \\n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \\n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \\n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \\n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \\n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \\n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \\n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \\n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \\n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \\n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \\n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \\n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \\n scattered bones of the dead.\" \\n\\np. 15 (second paragraph).\\n\\n\"The Tartars were, for the most part, poor. Some of them lived in villages \\n and cultivated small farms; many of them continued in the way of life of \\n their nomadic forefathers. They drove their flocks and herds from valley \\n to valley, from plain to mountain, and from mountain to plain, following \\n the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. They ranged from the salt \\n desert shores of the Caspian Sea far into the mighty Caucasus Mountains. \\n Even the village Tartars are a primitive people, only semicivilized.\"\\n\\n\"I can see now that we Armenians frankly despised the Tartars, and, while \\n holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country, regarded and\\n treated them as inferiors. The fact that the Russians looked down upon all\\n Armenians in much the same way as Armenians regarded Tartars, far from proving\\n a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors, intensified\\n an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility.\"\\n\\np. 20 (second paragraph).\\n\\n\"Our men armed themselves, gathered together and advanced on the Tartar\\n section of the village. There were no lights in the houses and the doors\\n were barred, for the Tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great \\n fear. Our men hammered on the doors, but got no response; whereupon they\\n smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last\\n Tartar was slain. Throughout the hideous night, I cowered at home in terror,\\n unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and\\n the loud shouts of our men. By morning the work was finished.\"\\n\\np. 109 (second paragraph).\\n\\n\"As things were, the members of the Dashnack Party were without administrative\\n experience; consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself\\n incompetent to rule by legitimate means.\\n\\n The members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and\\n outside the law. When they became a legally instituted, recognized governing\\n body with the destiny of Armenia in their hands, they proved incompetent to \\n do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their \\n fight against the Russian and Turkish Governments in their outlaw days.\\n\\n The outstanding feature of their rule, now that they were in power, was,\\n as in the old days, trial and execution without hearing. A man evoking\\n the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and\\n condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. The method \\n of execution was for a government \\'mauserist\\' to walk up behind the\\n condemned man in his home or on the street, place a pistol to the back\\n of his head and blow out his brains. This simple way of getting rid of\\n those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became\\n a common way of paying debts.\"\\n\\np. 203 (first paragraph).\\n\\n\"A soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the Tartar. I saw the\\n point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...Another soldier seized a rock \\n and pounded the Tartar\\'s head with it... The Armenian who had bayoneted him\\n sprang to his feet, wrested the weapon from the Tartar\\'s body, and, raising\\n it to his lips, licked it clean of blood, exclaiming in Russian, \\'Slodkey!\\n Slodkey!\\' (Sweet.)\"\\n\\np. 203 (second paragraph).\\n\\n\"One evening I passed through what had been a Tartar village. Among the \\n ruins a fire was burning. I went to the fire and saw seated about\\n it a group of soldiers. Among them were two Tartar girls, mere children.\\n The girls were crouched on the ground, crying softly with suppressed\\n sobs. Lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and\\n other furnishings of Tartar peasant homes. There were also bodies of the\\n dead.\"\\n\\np. 204 (first paragraph).\\n\\n\"I was soon asleep. In the night I was awakened by the persistent crying of\\n a child. I arose and went to investigate. A full moon enabled me to make\\n my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy\\n that had been enacted. Guided by the child\\'s crying, I entered the yard of\\n a house, which I judged from its appearance must have been the home of a\\n Turkish family. There in a corner of the yard I found a women dead. Her\\n throat had been cut. Lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a\\n year old.\"\\n\\np. 118.\\n\\n\"Slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow, the cart\\n jolting and the loads swaying. Boys ran along the line of oxen, encouraging\\n them with shrill Tartar cries, and belaboring the beasts with sticks. In the\\n carts, the women, veiled as is the Tartar way, held children in their arms.\\n Wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they\\n sought protection from the wind and cold. A few old men plodded along on foot.\\n\\n Across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. The leading\\n oxteam reached this barrier and halted. The gunmen and other ruffians \\n concealed among the rocks opened fire. Women and children leaped and\\n scrambled from the carts, screamed, ran and sought vainly for safety.\\n\\n This massacre was not complete. The Armenian soldiers in the near-by \\n barracks, hearing the firing and the turmoil, hurried to the scene....\\n That same day the abandoned Tartar quarter of Alexandropol was looted\\n and completely destroyed.\"\\n\\np. 192.\\n\\n\"Great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding-places on the\\n retreat of the Turks followed our army as it advanced.... They entered\\n into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores\\n that had been left by the Turks.\"\\n\\np. 193.\\n\\n\"Terrible vengeance was taken upon Tartars, Kurds and Turks. Their villages\\n were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country.\"\\n\\np. 195.\\n\\n\"The fanatical Dashnacks hated the Turks above all others and then in order\\n of diminishing intensity: Tartars, Kurds and Russians.\" \\n\\np. 218.

This is true for all\\nIsraeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. In the United States most\\nofficial forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.).\\n\\n>\\n> 2.

I wouldn\\'t exactly\\ncall it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate\\nto disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases\\nin camera.\\n\\n\\n>\\n> 5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied\\n> territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?\\n>\\n\\nNot Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the\\nKNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens\\nresiding in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze,\\nor Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n> 6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48\\n> to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their\\n> Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?\\n\\nAnyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be\\nconfusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the\\nSix Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he\\ncouldn\\'t reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).\\n\\n\\n>\\n> 7.      Is it true that Israel\\'s Prime Minister, Y.

Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as\\n> members in kibbutzim?\\n\\nNot true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on\\nkibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn\\'t be admitted to a\\nkibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so\\nin the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous\\nmembership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.\\n\\n\\n>\\n> 9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage\\n> marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?\\n\\nThe religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the\\nreligious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the\\nMuslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their\\nreligious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious\\nestablishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.\\n\\n>\\n> 10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the\\n> site of a muslim cemetery ?\\n\\nI believe it\\'s adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I\\'d\\nlike to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not\\nheld that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews.

A year before the war\\nerupted here last April, Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began\\nstockpiling supplies, ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for\\nplaces in Israel and Europe for the evacuees.\\n \\nThey were so well prepared, he said, that only five days after the\\nshooting began the first plane left. Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia-\\nHerzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind\\nwork in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into a\\nwartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals.\\n \\nThe center, which has been shelled several times along with most of\\nSarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes food\\npackages sent by Jewish organizations around the world.\\n \\nWhile Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews here\\nsay there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and\\ntolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to\\ncenturies of Turkish occupation.\\n \\nSarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman\\nCatholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14,000 before\\nWorld War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out\\nby the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia.

This is the same gorge into which the road from\\nErzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the\\nfrontier; the railway, however, follows the main Aras River val-\\nley till the frontier gorge enters it, whilst the road cuts off the\\ncorner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin,\\nsome 15 miles from the main valley.\\n\\nSoon after entering the gorge, we were confronted by the\\nfirst serious fall of rock--about 2,000 tons having fallen from\\nthe cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track. Here,\\ntherefore, we halted, and, sending our engine back, prepared to\\n\\n\\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\\nS.D.P.A.

The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \\nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \\nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there\\'s no conversation \\nwhatsoever, and we couldn\\'t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \\nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \\nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn\\'t know. We bought our tickets. There \\nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \\nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \\nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \\nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \\nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \\nto Armenian girls. I thought that\\'s what they meant because they had demanded \\na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \\nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \\nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \\nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it\\'s\\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \\nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \\npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \\nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \\ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we\\'ve \\nscared them enough, let\\'s leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \\nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \\n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \\nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \\nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \\nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \\ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \\nand it was dark . . .\\n\\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that\\'s the center of town. Lenin\\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \\nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren\\'t especially \\nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn\\'t know if we were going to \\nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \\nwasn\\'t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \\npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \\nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \\nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \\nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \\nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \\nlive literally one stop away. We didn\\'t want to go on foot, not because it was\\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \\ndriver didn\\'t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \\nhe said he\\'d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \\nOK . . .\\n\\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \\nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \\nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they\\'re not going \\nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what\\'s going on, and there\\'s\\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \\ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that\\'s it . . . Somehow we managed to \\ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \\ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \\nnothing had happened.\\n\\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn\\'t go anywhere and \\ndidn\\'t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn\\'t\\nguess.\\n\\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \\nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \\nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \\nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\\nhome and didn\\'t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \\nZimogliad, came by at around three o\\'clock I think. We worked together, we did\\nour apprenticeships together, she\\'s a Russian girl. She said that something\\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don\\'t they want Armenians? Well what \\nare they after, if they\\'re already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \\nthat, it\\'s just a demonstration, but it\\'s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \\ncabs, the buses, well it\\'s just a nightmare.\\n\\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \\nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\\non in the courtyard; aren\\'t you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn\\'t know what she\\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \\nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn\\'t go see her, she\\'s a Russian,\\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o\\'clock I \\ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it\\'s time for you to go, it\\'s late already, I\\'ll see \\nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don\\'t need to go, it\\'s too late already, you can \\nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \\nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \\ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \\nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we\\'re eating.\\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \\nWe cleared the table.\\n\\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can\\'t \\nsee what\\'s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \\n. . . I can\\'t figure out what\\'s happening. They\\'re shouting something, looking\\nsomewhere, I can\\'t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she\\'s \\nan Azerbaijani; we\\'ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \\nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \\npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \\nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\\nthat means it\\'s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they\\'re not \\nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \\nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \\nfeet, everyone\\'s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \\ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can\\'t speak\\n. . . Well, they\\'ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn\\'t see if he\\ngot up and left or not.\\n\\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don\\'t go anywhere, stay at our\\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \\nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \\nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \\nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \\nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \\nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \\nkept them from coming in. There\\'s only one entryway there, they could stop \\nthem.\\n\\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \\nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \\nand it\\'s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don\\'t \\ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It\\'s just a huge\\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \\nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \\ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \\ndin and roar. It\\'s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \\nshouting Father\\'s name, \"Grisha, open the door, we\\'ve come to kill you!,\" or\\nsomething like that. I don\\'t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \\nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \\nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won\\'t come in there, \\nthey\\'ll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We\\'ll tell them \\nthat we live alone here.\" I can\\'t imagine that my parents will stand out in \\nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \\nthat I\\'ll stand together with them, I\\'ll talk with them if they come, maybe I \\ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \\nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can\\'t remember if I told \\nher anything or not.\\n\\nThen . . . they open the door: it\\'s like they blew on it and it broke and fell\\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \\nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We\\'ll gather everything we need and leave the \\napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \\ncommanding them: \"Don\\'t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\\n\\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \\nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \\nin front of Mamma. I don\\'t remember where they went, what they did, or how \\nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don\\'t even know what I said. The \\natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \\nthemselves who would go first.\\n\\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dead or alive. Someone comes\\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \\nHe looks around at what\\'s happening. At that instant everything stops. It \\nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we\\'re done here.\" They are beating\\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \\n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she\\'s dead. Papa . . . was\\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can\\'t get the \\nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \\nwindows can\\'t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \\nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She\\'s not a real strong \\nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I\\'m saying something, that\\nI\\'m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \\nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \\ndon\\'t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I\\'m dead, why would I \\nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that\\'s what I think, since my\\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \\n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\\n\\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don\\'t \\nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \\nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \\nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\\nelse is pinching me . . .I don\\'t even know. I think, my God, when will death \\ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \\nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don\\'t remember.\\n \\nI come to after a while, I don\\'t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \\nclothing. I\\'m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \\nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \\nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can\\'t make \\nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \\nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \\ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors\\', even though \\nhe\\'s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \\nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\\nthere, I think; now he\\'s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \\nbrought me to the neighbors\\', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \\n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I\\'m not one of them.\" How do I know who\\'s who \\nand what\\'s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \\nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \\nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we\\'ll let you go, we aren\\'t touching the\\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she\\'s going \\nto tell them she\\'s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina\\'s and Lyuda\\'s \\nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \\nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor\\'s and starts pounding \\non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \\nthere. So they survived.\\n\\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \\nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \\nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \\nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor\\'s on the fourth floor, the\\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \\nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I\\'m not going to let you \\nin the apartment because I\\'m afraid of them. But I\\'ll give you some stockings \\nand we\\'ll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I\\'ll stay at your place because of\\nwhat\\'s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \\nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn\\'t consent. Lyuda came \\nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\\n\\nI came to. Mother was there. I can\\'t remember my supervisor\\'s telephone \\nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \\ncame to get us. He didn\\'t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \\nsimply afraid, he didn\\'t know that they were killing us and that we had passed\\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \\nit was hard to breathe . . .\\n\\nMy supervisor\\'s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He\\'s the head of our \\nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \\npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \\nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \\ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \\nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \\nwithout stopping. After us.\\n\\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\\nfrom Building 16, that\\'s the building in front of ours. There young \\nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn\\'t let it into their building. \\nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors\\', Marina called our relatives\\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \\nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\\nquickly, I can\\'t explain what\\'s going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis\\', ones who won\\'t give you away.\" At that moment \\nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \\nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \\nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \\nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \\nhere, haven\\'t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \\nthe soldiers said, \"Don\\'t scream at us. We\\'re Muslims, but we\\'re not from the \\nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \\nDaghestan police were there.\\n\\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don\\'t know,\\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \\ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don\\'t know what they \\nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \\nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don\\'t \\nknow what to do with the rest.\"\\n\\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \\nboss said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \\nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \\nambulances hadn\\'t done anything, they didn\\'t respond to any calls. People \\ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\\n\\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \\n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \\nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don\\'t know what your people have been\\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \\nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don\\'t I just die so as not to\\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \\ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn\\'t \\nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \\nthink of something that yours haven\\'t already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \\nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \\nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn\\'t do anything to help us. This\\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn\\'t do anything \\nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn\\'t want any shots or tranquilizer, \\nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn\\'t even want to look at \\nthem.\\n\\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \\nyour brother what happened, there\\'s no point in asking me, your brother can \\nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \\nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\\nward.\\n\\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \\nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \\nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \\nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can\\'t believe you put on such a\\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \\nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \\nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \\ncouldn\\'t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\\nthat I couldn\\'t take the apples, and really didn\\'t have any appetite. No one \\nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \\nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \\nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \\nArmenian, maybe they wouldn\\'t figure it out from looking at me. So they must \\nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \\nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\\nthe street, I don\\'t know. In any case, I didn\\'t sleep a wink that night.\\n\\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \\nand off we went. I didn\\'t even know where they were taking me. They took me to\\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \\ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \\na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \\nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \\nafter that night. I still didn\\'t know what happened to my parents, they didn\\'t \\ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \\nI didn\\'t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \\nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \\na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \\nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \\nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \\ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \\ncould. Of course I\\'m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \\nwho didn\\'t lose his presence of mind and who didn\\'t change his opinions, \\nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \\nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \\n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \\nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \\nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\\nmyself I couldn\\'t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \\nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \\nfrom all the blows, I don\\'t know. They didn\\'t diagnose anything in particular.\\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \\ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \\nThere was no way something inside wasn\\'t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \\nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \\nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina\\'s \\nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children\\'s Clinic. \\nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\\nbreathing, I couldn\\'t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\\nwasn\\'t cut.\\n\\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \\nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \\ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \\ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It\\'s Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \\nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \\n\"We\\'ll only see Seidov\\'s daughter, have her come here, we\\'ll do the same \\nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we\\'ll deal with you \\nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \\nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \\nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \\nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \\nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \\nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \\nclub that didn\\'t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \\nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \\nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \\ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn\\'t sit or lie down, it \\nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \\ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \\nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \\nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \\nright and left. I just don\\'t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \\nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \\nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \\nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \\ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \\ntheater and there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \\nthe attic. I didn\\'t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \\ncouldn\\'t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \\nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn\\'t. I was in no condition to open my \\neyes.\\n\\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren\\'t you an \\nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you\\'re an Azerbaijani.\" They\\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \\nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\\nthey should have, with their IDs.\\n\\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn\\'t \\nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \\nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \\nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \\nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn\\'t take her in, so she ran about the \\nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \\nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \\nalready in the city.\\n\\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \\nfamilies. They say they didn\\'t even know for sure if the people were Armenians\\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I\\'m not sure myself, I didn\\'t \\nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it\\'s very difficult \\nnow to say exactly who died and who didn\\'t. It was very difficult to identify \\nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\\ngasoline and burned . . . it\\'s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \\nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \\nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\\nMicrodistrict 3.\\n\\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \\nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \\ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \\nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \\nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \\nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn\\'t see it myself, but I heard that they\\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \\nthe corpses, well you can\\'t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \\nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\\nG., if I\\'m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \\nshe still can\\'t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \\nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \\nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \\ncarried her to the city. I still can\\'t imagine how he managed to do that.\\n\\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \\npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \\nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \\nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \\nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \\ncouldn\\'t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone\\'s apartment and\\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\\nshe couldn\\'t remember anyone\\'s face.\\n\\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \\ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\\nout of my head. I can\\'t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\\nthe Secretary of the Directorate\\'s Party organization, where Marina works. She\\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I\\'m the \\nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \\nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \\nmeetings. I know them all, I\\'ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \\nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\\n\\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they\\'re working on our\\ncase, but I can\\'t even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\\nthe ones, they\\'re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \\ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \\nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \\npeople, all of them, as much as I\\'ve heard about them and seen them, they were\\nall from Kafan.\\n\\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \\nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn\\'t \\nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \\nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn\\'t see Marina \\nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn\\'t make out \\nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \\nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \\nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \\nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \\nwe\\'re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\\nhe\\'s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \\nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I\\'m crazy, not \\nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \\nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \\nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn\\'t at home, my family and \\nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn\\'t go to see our Procurator, our case is \\nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \\nthat Rzayev\\'s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \\nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \\nhead I can\\'t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \\ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn\\'t have to pay for it, but at the \\nsame time\\n\\nI\\'m afraid to say I\\'m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you\\'re wrong, he didn\\'t do that, that one\\nwasn\\'t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\\nexactly I can\\'t say.                                                     \\n\\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn\\'t see it, \\nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \\nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \\nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \\nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \\nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \\ndormitory is over there, that\\'s where he lives. Now he\\'s in custody, they even\\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \\nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\\n\\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn\\'t come \\nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \\nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \\ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \\nthey\\'ve caught him, everything\\'s been proved. Now, evidently, they\\'ve been\\nbeating him, I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with them over there, but he \\nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \\ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \\nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \\nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \\nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I\\'m going to go. But they didn\\'t\\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \\nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \\nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \\nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \\nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\\n\\nI\\'ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I\\'m satisfied with\\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \\nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \\nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don\\'t know. \\nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \\nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \\nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \\nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \\nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \\ncurfew, and I\\'ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \\nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \\nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \\nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don\\'t know what he did, \\nI can\\'t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \\nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there\\'s no need for this, \\nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you\\'re like a sister to me. I took a look\\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \\nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \\nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \\nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \\nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \\nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \\nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \\nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \\napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I\\'ve got three kids and \\nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn\\'t have \\nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \\napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \\napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That\\'s what they said. How did they \\nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \\nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \\nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn\\'t set fire to our \\napartment.\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \\nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \\nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \\nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They\\'re asking me! Well I just don\\'t know\\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \\nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn\\'t have been \\nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \\nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \\nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \\nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \\ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You\\'ll come in this entryway over my dead\\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \\nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn\\'t \\neven know what they were doing. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. They knew very well\\nwhat they were doing if they didn\\'t even lift a hand against that woman. They \\ncouldn\\'t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \\nstopped them.\\n\\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \\nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \\napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \\nMaybe I\\'m losing my mind? But no, they\\'re all chewing something. Maybe it is \\nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \\nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \\ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\\ndidn\\'t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \\nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we\\'re killing the Armenians!\" \\nOnly they didn\\'t shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \\nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s how it was! I\\'ll continue. We hid in a captain\\'s apartment, he\\'s an\\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \\nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \\nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn\\'t find\\nLyuda she took Papa\\'s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\\nbut they didn\\'t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\\ncourage to . . .\\n\\nA boy said to my mother \"Where\\'s the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \\nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \\nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \\nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \\nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn\\'t really like to \\nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \\nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \\nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \\nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \\nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \\ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \\ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \\nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \\nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \\naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \\n\"What\\'s happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \\nfind out what\\'s happening to my daughters, even if they\\'ve burned them or \\nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \\nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \\nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn\\'t get out \\nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \\nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \\nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \\nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\\nher mind. I\\'ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \\nway to me, I\\'ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \\ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don\\'t remember what order it\\nhappened in.\\n\\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they\\'re all running around down there, shouting \\nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \\nless calmed down where we were. Who\\'s dead, who\\'s alive, we don\\'t know. I \\ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\\nlet\\'s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don\\'t know how \\nlong we\\'ll be here. Maybe they didn\\'t burn everything.\" I don\\'t get it, all\\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \\nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \\nfor? To hell with it! We\\'re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\\nsays, \"No, let\\'s go get at least something. Maybe we\\'ll leave here, spend the \\nnight at someone else\\'s.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \\ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \\nshouts, \"Come back, they\\'re coming!\" They didn\\'t have enough time to get a \\nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \\nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father\\'s old coveralls. The neighbor, his \\nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \\nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \\nthey\\'re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \\nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \\nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \\nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\\n\\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\\nAsya Dallakian. She\\'s an old woman, retired. She wasn\\'t at home, at that\\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \\nsomething like that, she\\'s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \\nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \\nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \\nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \\nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \\nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren\\'t afraid, the ones who \\nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn\\'t know, but \\nthey didn\\'t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \\nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \\napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He\\'s an exserviceman, retired, works up \\nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don\\'t worry, we won\\'t harm you, you\\'re one of\\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren\\'t you taking anything from this \\napartment?\" He says, \"I don\\'t need anything.\" And the women who were standing \\nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \\nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \\nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \\nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \\npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \\nmad, and he says, \"Where\\'s the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \\n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\\ndirection.\\n\\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \\nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \\njust didn\\'t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \\nshe didn\\'t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \\nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \\nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where\\'s the girl who was here?\"\\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn\\'t\\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \\nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \\nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \\nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \\nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There\\'s so much water down there, she \\nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \\nthe basement. That\\'s it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn\\'t know that, and \\nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn\\'t \\njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\\n\\nAfter that we of course didn\\'t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \\ndidn\\'t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \\nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \\nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \\nwho sat in their apartments and didn\\'t help us at a time like that. I think \\nthat they could have helped! I don\\'t think that they were obligated to, but \\nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \\nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you\\'re doing?\" That\\'s \\nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \\none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \\nstanding on their balconies I didn\\'t hear anyone\\'s voice, no one said what are\\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \\nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \\none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \\nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \\nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \\nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\\nyou want to go on living, you\\'ll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\\nThat trick didn\\'t work on them.\\n\\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \\nthat it happened. I said I\\'d only forget it if I told them right then that it\\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn\\'t have any effect on them, \\nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \\nAnd no one did anything.

Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\\n\\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\\n  Empire.>>\\n\\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

As far as\\n  I can tell, you\\'re proposing the following rules of engagement\\n  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel\\n  revise this preliminary draft as necessary:\\n\\n  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform\\n     or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female\\n     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but\\n     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of\\n     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further\\n     provocation is required.\\n\\n  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant\\n     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans\\n     without positive identification as military personnel, clear\\n     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.\\n\\n    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for\\n       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively\\n       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or\\n       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note\\n       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,\\n       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive\\n       military identification and require closer inspection such\\n       as document checks.\\n\\n    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely \\'hostile\\' intent,\\n       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less\\n       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals\\n       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a\\n       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,\\n       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.\\n       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to\\n       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify\\n       armed response.\\n\\n    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive\\n       military identification of all personnel in the target area of\\n       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not\\n       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft\\n       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the\\n       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously\\n       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of\\n       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov\\n       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to\\n       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should\\n       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.\\n       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters\\n       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated\\n       if necessary.\\n\\n--- D.

Any uniform once on him was gone, so \\n I\\'d no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his  \\n slashed genitals.\"\\n\\np. 363 (first paragraph). \\n\\n \\'How many people lived there?\\'\\n \\'Oh, about eight hundred.\\' He yawned.\\n \\'Did you see any Turk officers?\\'\\n \\'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.\\'\\n\\n \"The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - \\n Dro\\'s. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled\\n so long and furiously I\\'d never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into \\n laughter, quick and simple as child\\'s. Both were a cover for his sense\\n of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,\\n Christian massacring \\'infidels\\' was more horrible than the reverse would\\n have been.\\n\\n From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....\\n The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over\\n the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel\\'s chattels, the last \\n scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, \\n looms, even spinning-wheels.\\n\\n \\'Thank you for a lot, Dro,\\' I said to him back in camp. \\'But now I must \\n leave.\\'...We shook hands, the captain said \\'A bientot, mon camarade.\\' And \\n for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. \\n Like Lot\\'s wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in \\n a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.\\'\"\\n\\np. 354.\\n\\n\"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole\\n high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,\\n but I got their contempt for Allied \\'neutral\\' zones and their distrust\\n of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on\\n Moslem villages.\"\\n\\np. 358.\\n\\n\"It will be three hours to take,\" Dro told me. We\\'d close in on three\\n sides.\\n\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\" Merrimanov\\nsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.\\n\"That is for morale,\" Dro put in. \"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\"\\n\"Soldiers or civilians?\" I asked.\\n\"There is no difference,\" said Dro. \"All are armed, in uniform or not.\"\\n\"But the women and children?\"\\n\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\"\\n\\np. 360.\\n\\n\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet \\n down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. \\'Djul lies under that,\\' said \\n Dro, pointing. \\'Our men also attack from the other sides.\\'\\n\\n Then, \\'Whee-ee!\\' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \\n I heard our Utica brass roar.\\n\\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\\n The came a shrill wailing.\\n\\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke.

Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\\n\\n \\'Tartarski!\\' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women\\'s cries.\\n\\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \\n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\\n through alders, on smoldering houses.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov District. That\\'s in Azerbaijan, near the\\nNagorno Karabagh region.\\n\\nAfter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically\\nin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \"uprising\" in\\nAzerbaijani, but I don\\'t think it was really an uprising, just a \\ndemonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the \\nZhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \\nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \\nand went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There\\nwere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the\\nArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.\\nI was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew \\nwouldn\\'t let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really \\nbad. I didn\\'t know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\\n\"There\\'s unrest everywhere, be careful.\" Well I had a project going on. I told\\nthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on \\nand said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn\\'t allow it, they \\nsaid, \"Nothing\\'s going to happen to you, we\\'ve entrusted the matter to the \\npolice, we\\'ve warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\" \\nWell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \\nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This\\nman didn\\'t leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \\nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\\n\\nI sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \"The situation is\\nvery tense, be careful.\"\\n\\nWe finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the\\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I\\nshouldn\\'t tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else\\'s\\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \\nand my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, \\nthey sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that\\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out \\nthey knew what was happening in Sumgait.\\n\\nI arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is\\nclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the \\nbuses aren\\'t running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two\\nminutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private\\ndrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \"Let\\'s go find some other way to get\\nthere.\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\\ntake us to Sumgait.\\n\\nHe took us there. But the others had said, \"I wouldn\\'t go if you gave me a\\nthousand rubles.\" \"Why?\" \"Because they\\'re burning the city and killing the\\nArmenians. There isn\\'t an Armenian left.\" Well I got hold of myself so I could\\nstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \\nset off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \"In fact there aren\\'t any\\nArmenians left. \\'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\" Well \\nI was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, \\n\"How old are you, old man?\" He wants to know: if I\\'m being that quiet, not \\nsaying anything, maybe it means I\\'m an Armenian. \"How old are you?\" he asks \\nme. I say, \"I\\'m 47.\" \"I\\'m 47 too, but I call you \\'old man\\'.\" I say, \"It \\ndepends on God, each person\\'s life in this world is different.\" I look much\\nolder than my years, that\\'s why he called me old man. Well after that he was\\nsilent, too.\\n\\nWe\\'re approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he\\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I\\'m sitting there with\\nthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant\\nthere were no Armenians with us.\\n\\nI look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \\nstreet, you know, and there\\'s no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They\\nstopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature \\nshafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .\\n\\nAlong the way the driver tells us how they know who\\'s an Armenian and who\\'s \\nnot. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I\\'m an Armenian, but I speak \\ntheir language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for \\n\"nut,\" or \"little nut,\" as \"pundukh,\" but \"fundukh\" is actually correct. The \\npronunciations are different. Anyone who says \"pundukh,\" even if they\\'re not \\nArmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, \\n\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\" he says. \"They started \\nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn\\'t let the\\npeople out,\" he says, \"they wouldn\\'t let them get out of the car.\" I only saw \\nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from\\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\\n\\nWhen they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there\\'s a short guy,\\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \"We\\'re\\nAzerbaijani,\\' they tell him, \\'no Armenians here.\" He did come up to me when \\nwe were pulling our things out and says, \"Maybe you\\'re an Armenian, old man?\" \\nBut in Azerbaijani I say, \"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" And . . . he \\nleft. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had \\nto . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own \\nhome.\\n\\nThey stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that\\'s where the Kavkaz store \\nand three large, 12-story buildings are. That\\'s the beginning of down-town. I \\nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \\ncouldn\\'t figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it \\nwas a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \\nremained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I\\nsaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About\\n30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.\\n\\nI see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are\\nclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\\ncrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it\\'s true, but pistol shots.\\nSeveral shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \\nSomeone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \\nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one \\narmored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \\noff Sumgait.\\n\\nI walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by \\ntheir gait that they\\'re not bandits, they\\'re just people, walking home. I\\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\\nBut I avoided the large groups because I\\'m a local and might be quickly \\nrecognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\\npeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\\nI can\\'t get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as \\nto get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \\nbehind him. And he\\'s shouting into a megaphone: \"Comrades, the Armenian-\\nAzerbaijani war has begun!\"\\n\\nThe police have megaphones like that. So they\\'re talking and walking around \\nthe second microdistrict. I see that they\\'re coming my way, and turn off \\nbehind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \\nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were \\ndoing I can\\'t say, because I couldn\\'t get up close to them, I was afraid. But \\nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\\n\\n   April 20, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday\\n\\n        The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be \\n        little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian \\n        fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week. \\n\\n        Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the \\n        Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of \\n        how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25 \\n        February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the \\n        surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in \\n        one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were \\n        shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I \\n        also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift \\n        hospital in a string of railway carriages. \\n\\n        Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by \\n        Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov \\n        Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to \\n        his  town.   \" So where are the rest?\".  Some might have  taken \\n        prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the \\n        mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to \\n        retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of \\n        cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees. \\n\\n        One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at \\n        first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting \\n        to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict. \\n        But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored \\n        personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend \\n        themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the \\n        forests. In the small hours, the massacre started. \\n\\n        Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken \\n        prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that \\n        troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack \\n        Khojaly. \"It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes.\" \\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Far from it.\\nI am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be\\nuniversally agreed to be morally incorrect. There are not many such\\nthings. But there are some. As an example:\\n\\n(1) murder is morally incorrect\\n\\n(2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to\\nanother is morally incorrect\\n\\netc.\\n\\nThe point is that any action which serves to promote a morally\\nincorrect action should be forbidden. This implies that no one has the\\nright to say that an innocent person should be murdered. Regardless of\\nfreedom of speech, I may not stand on a street corner and advocate the\\nmurder of innocent people. The reason for this is that murder is a\\nmorally incorrect action.\\n\\nIn the same way, since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow\\ndefinition which we have given it, (2), I, nor any one else, has the\\nright to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. Such an\\nenforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by\\nthe first amendment. It merely ensures that no person may be the\\ntarget of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right, such as\\nthe right to not be murdered, and the right not to be discriminated\\nagainst.\\n\\nI believe, Mr. Berson, that to blindly accept the constitution is a\\nterrific mistake. We must cinstantly question the constitution and\\ninterpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. Anything\\nshort of such an effort would render us little more than trained\\nmonkeys, who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without\\npaying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in\\nquestion.\\n\\nWould you disagree, Mr.Berson?\\n\\nHarry.\\n\"),\n",

The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\\n\\n\\t- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\\n\\t  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\\n\\t  brings the death penalty.  \\n\\n\\t  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn\\'t he Ilyess?\\n\\n\\t- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\\n\\t  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\\n\\t  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\\n\\t  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\\n\\t  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\\n\\t  prostitutes.\\n\\n\\t  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I\\'ve\\n\\t  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\\n\\t  has no basis in the Qur\\'an, the ahadith, etc.\\n\\t  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\\n\\t  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \\n\\n\\t  If I were you, I\\'d choose my heroes wisely,\\n\\t  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\\n\\t  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\\n\\n\\t- say that women should not be allowed to work.\\n\\n\\t- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\\n\\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\\nlast six months or so I\\'ve read there have been stepped up harassing\\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).

So the\\ngovernment has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of\\nthe wind out of the sails of the more-conservative opposition.\\nAs unislamic as some of these things are, they\\'re just a small\\ntaste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the House of\\nSaud, like they\\'re trying to in the long run.\\n\\nIs this really what you (and Rached and others in the general\\nwest-is-evil-zionists-rule-hate-west-or-you-are-a-puppet crowd)\\nwant, Ilyess?\\n\\n--\\nDave Bakken\\n==>\"the President is doing a fine job, but the problem is we don\\'t know what\\n    to do with her husband.\" James Carville (Clinton campaign strategist),2/93\\n==>\"Oh, please call Daddy.

A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\\n\\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\\nbodies.

It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\\nand products to wash the dead.\"\\n\\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will\\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\\nlawyer said at his small office.\\n\\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\\nFebruary.\\n\\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\\npilot.\\n\\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\\nreturn.\"\\n\\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\\n\\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/\\'92\\n\\n\\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\\n\\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\\n\\n\"I\\'m still  wearing the same  clothes, I don\\'t have  any others,\"\\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\\nbe alive.\"\\n\\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\\nedge of Karabakh.\\n\\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\\n\\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\\nof  the  attack.

Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\\n67-year-old elder brother.\\n\\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\\n\\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group\\'s\\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\\n\\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\\n\\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\\nsoon to flee.\\n\\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\\nrocket attack.

It has to do with\\nthe search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that\\njustice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967\\nare not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called\\npragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can\\nnever be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace.\\nIt is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the\\nlaw, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not\\nnormal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than\\nWestern democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to\\nmarry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have\\ndrawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to\\ncompensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy\\nendure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day\\nwill come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society,\\nin which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic\\naffiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any\\nmore. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their\\ntraditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western\\ndemocracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that\\nmost\\nAmerican Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed\\nChristian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.\\n\\nI would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views\\nand personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile\\noutbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect\\nJudaism are uncivilized.

We are\\nagreed, aren\\'t we, that dictionaries are *reference books* for the usage\\nof a given language, and in particular for the meanings of the words and\\nphrases which comprise that language?  Now, you are using meanings\\ncompletely different from, indeed in some cases diametrically different\\nfrom, those given in the dictionary.  As a reference book, a dictionary\\ncontains those meanings in both past and (as much as it can) in current\\nuse.  That\\'s also why they are updated so often.

Just about no one will take you that way because the\\nwords mean something different to them.

In English idiom, the phrase\\n\"and guess why...\" in the way you used it is a loaded question, with\\nonly one answer expected.  \\n\\nI also take offense at being told I cannot read by someone who is\\nobviously having trouble with the subject himself.

No conflict is ever resolved \\nwithout discussion.\\n\\n[A] I\\'ll try first. Recently I received a message from\\n[A] a Russian guy who frequently visited Baku that \\n[A] approximately after 1986 the old situation when \\n[A] there were no anti-Armenian press had changed and\\n[A] the press became very anti-Armenian and average\\n[A] Azeri became an Armenian-hater. This is devastation \\n[A] news for me because one of my cornerstones was the fact\\n[A] that I MYSELF SAW ARMENIANS IN BAKU AMONG OTHER ETHNIC\\n[A] GROUPS AND SAW, OR HEARD, OR READ NOTHING THAT WOULD\\n[A] SEEM LIKE HATRED. You might say that an outsider never \\n[A] sees, but by that time I was myself victimized as a member\\n[A] of a minority by Russians and knew what to look for and\\n[A] what innocent sign or remark might signify.\\n\\nI am sure. The Soviet Union effectively froze in time all ethnic problems it\\ncreated or was brewing just after WWI. During the Soviet reign, officials \\ntended to shape the frozen conflicts in such a way so when thawed, they \\nwould serve the purposes of the internal policies of the Soviet Union or\\nsuccessor states.\\n\\n[A] Again - one of my cornerstones show cracks. I will investigate.\\n[A] Another cornerstone of my thought is that Armenia started\\n[A] hostilities against Azeris in Armenia before anything happened\\n[A] in Sumgait (not at all I am trying to justify violence in Sumgait\\n[A] or anywhere else - I bow my head with grief and respect and \\n[A] did demand and will laways demand that criminals be severely\\n[A] punished according to the law of the land.\\n[A] I would like you to supply me with the information about that.\\n[A] Does or does not the hostilities began in Armenia? Was thousands\\n[A] od Azeris thrown out of their homes and forced to leave Armeina\\n[A] before Sumgait or not? \\n\\nSumgait took place in February of 1988. The Azeris of Armenia were expelled\\nin the late fall of 1988. It took the entire summer of 1988 for the\\nsituation to get so bad for Azeris in Armenian that the Russians had to\\nevacuate them. I refer specifically to _Human Rights Violations in Armenia\\nand Azerbaijan_, A report of Pax Christi Netherlands 12 September 1991. Also,\\none need only read the newspaper to verify this. \\n\\nYou do realize, perhaps unknowingly -- perhaps not -- you are mirroring \\nTurkish propaganda and lies regarding what took place when and where first!\\n\\n[A] Second - in your last message you used a very terrifying\\n[A] phrase - \"Artificial borders\" when you were talking about \\n[A] Armenian. Do you believe that Armenia have righteous territorial\\n[A] claims? Do you believe that Armenia has rights to the lands that\\n[A] currently belong to other countries? \\n[A] Do you believe that this is stricktly Armenian priviledge or\\n[A] everybody should start reclaiming what once was theirs?\\n\\nI had addressed this issue several time before -- perhaps I was not clear. The\\ncurrent borders of Armenia were not set as a result of the consolidation of\\na high Armenian culture. Today\\'s Armenia is about 1/10 the land mass that\\nsustained Armenians for nearly three millennia. It was the natural Armenian\\nboundaries that sustained Armenians -- not the current boundaries. The current\\nborders of Armenia would never support a society nor sustain its growth. Does \\nthis mean that Armenia should expand? It might, if Armenia is not allowed to \\nintegrate into the region. If this past winter is any indication of the future \\nstatus of Armenia, then Armenia must do what it will to survive. \\nUnfortunately, in my opinion, and you can quote me on this, as I am sure you \\nand others will, the combined forces of both Armenia and Karabakh should have \\ntaken Karabakh and the land in between in a matter of weeks in late 1991. This \\nwould avoided all the pain and suffering both sides endured and would remove a \\ntool of Russian influence in the Caucasus. You may call me a war-monger -- so \\nbe it. If Armenians don\\'t defend their right to live on the land they live on, \\nthose rights will be taken away. The Azeris should not have the right to \\nremove these Armenians, but given the first chance to, they will, as was \\nproven throughout all of Azerbaijan. If the Soviet Union didn\\'t break apart, \\ntoday Karabakh would be emptied of Armenians. Operation Ring, started in early \\n1991 emptied the northern 1/3 of Karabakh of Armenians, but the operation was \\nsuspended by the disillusionment of the Soviet Union. Lucky for the Armenians! \\nIf the Azeris feel as though they can expel all the Armenians of Karabakh, the \\nArmenians will resist, if the Armenians can\\'t live under Azeri oppression, \\nthen they will fight for the right to live their lives free from such \\noppression. If this means these Armenian demand independence, I support such a \\nmove. If you can\\'t understand this, as an Azeri, that is truly unfortunate. \\nUntil this is understood by the Gray Wolves in Baku, more young Azeri men will \\ndie in the pursuit of the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Karabakh \\nArmenians.\\n \\n[A] Third thing - you keep saying about 3000 years of Armenian presence\\n[A] in Karabakh. What exactly you mean by that? That there were Armenians\\n[A] 3000 years ago in Karabah? Only Armenians? Or among other nations?\\n[A] I saw (SAW) a Russian tax map of Karabah with all the landowners and\\n[A] occupant names on it (the map was surveyed by Russian Army in 1810.\\n[A] Would you believe that there were almost exclusivly Achmeds and Hu-\\n[A] sseins? I also saw Armenian names, but the absolute majority of the\\n[A] population was Muslim. If I am wrong - give me your sources, but\\n[A] please, let us keep the rule that we only pay attention to third\\n[A] party sources.\\n[A] There are Russian diplomatic documents about the mission of the\\n[A] Russian famous writer and diplomat Griboedov whose mission in Iran\\n[A] was protection of Armenians that were persecuted by Persians and\\n[A] RELOCATION these Armenians inside Russian Empire. According to\\n[A] the Russian tax documents that was the time when the population of\\n[A] Karabakh became predominantly (in some places) Armenian.\\n\\nKarabakh, or Artsakh as it is known in Armenian (and Urartian) is the only\\npiece of Armenia that has a continuous Armenian occupation, from the\\ntransformation of the Urartians to Armenians, nearly 3,000 years ago. You\\nrefer to Russian and Muslim rulers over Karabakh, not the population! You\\nsurely must know the rules of Muslim landownership over non-Muslims.\\n\\n[A] You write in your letter that \"Azeris were shelling Stepanakert which\\n[A] now is almost completely destroyed\"  David - is it fair to say that \\n[A] Stepanakert was destroyed by Azeris? There is that fine line between\\n[A] propaganda and personal view, however bizzarre that view is - YOU KNOW\\n[A] AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO SAW TV IN THE TIMES OF THE EARTHQUAKE - that \\n[A] Stepanakert was almost completely devastated by the quake. \\n[A] But may be you believe that the damage from Azeri shelling is greater\\n[A] than the damage from the quake? OK, no problem, AS LONG AS YOU MENTION\\n[A] THE QUAKE. \\n\\nAs I wrote in a short response to you regarding this earlier. You may be\\nconfusing Spitak with Stepanakert. There were no effects of the earthquake \\nin Karabakh.\\n\\n[A] I want dialog. I am not interested in mud-throwing. And in dialog I want\\n[A] honest opinions (one might be wrong, but one MUST be honest). Honest \\n[A] opinions may be based on emotions but in this case one should indicate\\n[A] that. But mostly we are looking for information based opinions.\\n[A] I always ask myself - why I think that? Is it because I was told so\\n[A] bt so many people that it became a truth? Or I read a book? Who wrote\\n[A] it? What was his/her intentions/interests/whatever? \\n\\nFine. I stated my opinions and the reasons for them. If you put into action \\nwhat you just stated above, you would understand my outrage at the posting of \\nFarid who just posted items from some Islamic conference, etc., and just left \\nit at that. He has done his numerous times. At least I responded to that \\nposting, and was outraged that Farid simply copies other people`s text, posts \\nit -- yet does not display the courage be responsible for what he posts. One \\ncan always stand behind the facade of claiming what I write is polemic, \\nhowever, as a result such irresponsibility I am free to make a claim of \\ncowardice. \\n\\n[A] Please, give me sources, facts, titles of the books of third party\\n[A] writers, etc.\\n\\nI believe I have, and can support what I claim. I don\\'t make up history, nor\\ndo I have to! I have done enough research regarding Turkish Genocide Apology \\nto revisionism from good scholarship, and I will never fall victim to \\nbottomless pit of making claims without a solid basis.\\n\\n[A] And please, answer my questions in the beginning of the letter.\\n\\n[A] And for you Armenian friends who do not like what I write - \\n[A] sorry, but these are my thoughts and it is very disturbing\\n[A] that you like people when they say what you like and dislike\\n[A] them when they say something that you do not like. \\n\\nAlex, I stated my friends and associates where rather surprised as the tone of\\nyour posting considering the fact that I had categorized you as an open-minded \\nAzeri. Perhaps I was fooled by you? Perhaps I should believe that you are like \\n\"all Azeris when it comes to Armenians\". I chose not to accept such a \\nstatement. They were not surprised at what you said so much as it was coming \\nfrom you, somebody from which they expected otherwise. You see, you didn\\'t add \\nanything to the issue, which was the expectation, only conforming old\\nsuspicions.\\n\\n[A] For me\\n[A] it is most inportant that a guy makes a honest effort to find\\n[A] the truth. If so, he/she might have whatever opinion he/she\\n[A] wants. I believe that telling people the truth, seeking it - is \\n[A] far more noble than just support your race because it is yours.\\n[A] That is a way of animals, primitive tribes and criminal societies.\\n[A] Civilized people seek truth.\\n\\n[A] Cheers,\\n\\n[A] Alex\\n\\nIf you think I am intellectually dishonest, please demonstrate it. As I stated\\nabove, I am partisan on this issue, thus expect me to take a stand in the\\ninterest of the Armenians, not against Armenians. This stance should not seem \\nstrange to you. I am not here to generate excuses for Armenians wanting to \\nlive on the land they live on, and wanting to live in peace. If Armenians must \\ndie for what they believe in, and make ultimate sacrifice, you had better \\nlisten to them. No amount of rhetoric -- not from Yerevan, Baku, the CSCE, nor \\npaid prostitutes in Washington -- will convince Karabakh Armenians otherwise! \\n\\n\\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"Armenia has not learned a lesson in\\nS.D.P.A.

Machiavelli described the reasoning in the\\nPrince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud\\nbeleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous\\npopulation.\\n\\nThe pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the \\nredefinition of much land used in common as \"public land\". The assertion\\nthat the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to\\nan invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an\\nexcuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought\\nin to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the\\nGeneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories\\nmust not be changed. \\n\\nNo amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists\\nwill change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of\\nthose that actually have any power have condemned this practice.\\n\\n\\n|>\\tThe government had a number of reasons for encouraging people\\n|>to move across the green line.

Shaw  (History),  who  recently\\ncompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the\\nTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey\\'s Role in\\nRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,\\n1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\\n\\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\\n\\nShaw: Basically, I\\'m  an Ottoman historian, but  I\\'m also Jewish.\\nI\\'ve  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\\n\\n- How exactly did they do this?\\n\\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\\nNazis\\' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\\nto be a Turkish Jew.\\n\\n- How so?\\n\\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\\nofficials and say in effect:  \"These people are Turkish citizens.\\nYou  can\\'t do  this  to  them.\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\\n\\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\\nParis,  and that\\'s  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\\nconsuls took place.\\n\\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\\nconsuls couldn\\'t declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \"irregular fellow\\ncitizen.\" The  document said in  effect \"This person is  a former\\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\"  The\\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\\n\\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\\n\\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\\n\\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\\ngovernments really didn\\'t want the Jews to escape. As a result of\\nthe Turkish consuls\\' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\\n\\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\\nfrom Nazi persecution.\\n\\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  \"You  are  dividing   our  citizens\\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\" American consuls\\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\\ncouldn\\'t do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\\nthat  time people  didn\\'t know  what  was going  on. They  didn\\'t\\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren\\'t able to help much in\\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\\n\\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\\nsend money and food out of the country.\\n\\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\\nliving in Israel.\\n\\nYes, and  their children. But  let\\'s return  for a moment  to the\\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\\n\\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\\n\\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\\n\\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\\n\\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\\ncould see the documents.\\n\\n- What languages are used in the documents?\\n\\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale\\'s  department store in New York\\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\\n\\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn\\'t\\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\\nsomeday will make the effort.\\n\\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nRight. I\\'m  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I\\'ve been actively\\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\\n\\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\\n\\nI\\'m working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\\nall sorts of political movements.\\n\\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\\nUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to\\nUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the\\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute\\nin  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National\\nEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He\\nhas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and\\nBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor\\nfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish\\nstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and\\nCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in\\nWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional\\nservice activities and public lectures  in both the United States\\nand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited\\nvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2\\nvols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or\\nreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,\\n1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire\\nand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York\\nUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation\\nby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the\\nHolocaust: Turkey\\'s  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry\\nfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan\\nPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.

The conditions were\\nwonderful, thanks to our Armenians, who received us. But it\\'s not relaxing all\\nthe same. I don\\'t know how everyone else feels about it, but for me it\\'s \\ntorture. We don\\'t have a place to call our own. I had a two bedroom apartment \\nin Sumgait, my children went to school and we lived well, in friendship. It\\'s \\npainful that in our times, in 1988, in the Soviet period, people can break \\ninto our apartment and try to kill me and my children, in whom I\\'ve put all my\\nefforts and my whole youth. Everything was going well for us: my older \\ndaughter was studying at the Institute, the middle one was preparing to enter \\nmedical school and was interning as an orderly, and my youngest had been sick \\nfor a long time, but had returned to health. I have been though a lot in my \\nlife: it\\'s been seven years since I lost my husband, I raised my children by \\nmyself. Lots of women have similar fates, but there\\'s nothing to be done about\\nit. But I can\\'t control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on \\nFebruary 27, 28, and 29, it was just a horror, it\\'s indescribable.\\n\\nOn February 27 our relative, Ira, came to visit us. She\\'s better friends with\\nmy oldest daughter, and so right away she asked, \"Where\\'s Vika?\" I say,\\n\"Vika\\'s off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days, she\\'s supposed to come back\\ntomorrow.\" My middle daughter, Gaya, had baked a cake and we sat there talking\\nand laughing, drinking tea. Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home.\\n\\nThey left and a few minutes went by; suddenly I hear noise. I raced out to\\nthe balcony--our balcony is right across from the bus station, we live at the\\ncorner of Mir and Druzhba Streets--I look and see that there are hoards of\\npeople near the bus station and they\\'re all shouting something. What they\\'re\\nshouting I can\\'t understand. Our neighbor is standing on his balcony, too. I\\nask, \"Nufar, what\\'s happened?\" He says, \"I don\\'t know, I can\\'t figure it out\\neither.\" I got scared--the kids had gone outside, and I wanted to run after\\nthem, but then there was a knock at the door. I open the door and it\\'s the\\nkids. \"Mamma,\" says Gayane, \"you\\'ll never believe what\\'s going on out there! \\nIt\\'s awful!\" Ira says, \"Aunt Zina, they\\'re shouting, \\'Karabagh! Karabagh! \\nKarabagh is ours!\\' We didn\\'t know what was going on. They\\'re threatening to \\ndrive out the Armenians and slaughter them.\"\\n\\nI called my brother, and his wife answered the phone. I said, \"Aunt Tamara, \\ndon\\'t worry, Ira is staying here with us, and we\\'ll see her home later.\" I \\ncouldn\\'t shut my eyes all night long, even until morning. I was worried about\\nVika. My God, what was going on, what had happened?!\\n\\n-Gayane: That day, on the 27th, we stood on the balcony and observed what was \\nhappening, although Mamma wouldn\\'t allow us to watch all of it. There weren\\'t \\n50 yards between our building and the bus station. We could see and hear \\neverything perfectly. They were stopping buses, dragging people out, leading \\nall the passengers out, looking for Armenians. If they found an Armenian on \\nthe bus, then it started . . .I don\\'t know what to call it . . .\\n\\n-Zinaida: It\\'s called slaughter.\\n\\n-Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them. I don\\'t know if they \\nwere killing them or not, but when they left them, they lay still, not moving,\\nas though nothing was left of them. One person was lying there and they \\nstarted dragging him. The police were standing right there, to the side, not \\ndoing anything, they didn\\'t take any steps to calm that mob.\\n\\nIt was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. And you \\ncouldn\\'t go anywhere, somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything\\nso as to tell of it later. We wanted to leave Sumgait that day. What kept us\\nwas the idea that we live in the Soviet Union, and that something would be\\ndone about it. Where in the world was our government?!\\n\\n-Zinaida: We couldn\\'t leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn\\'t\\nhome. And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana. On Sunday \\nmorning when I went to see Ira home, our neighbor said, \"Zin\\', you know they \\nwent into Valodya\\'s house and smashed everything he had. They murdered his \\nfather and two sons.\" Valodya is our neighbor, he\\'s an Armenian, he lives on \\nthe first floor. I think, my God, what is happening?! And in broad daylight!\\n\\nI saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting \"Slay the\\nArmenians! Karabagh is ours!\" This was at 12 o\\'clock in the afternoon. On the \\nway I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says, \"They beat our store\\nmanager, they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him, but he was an \\nAzerbaijani.\" And I asked, \"Did they kill him?\" She says, \"No, he\\'s in serious\\ncondition.\" I left there and started to walk home on that same street, but the\\nmob started moving in my direction. I turned off the street and went down the \\nlittle way that goes toward the Sputnik store. There I met another crowd, but \\nthese weren\\'t bandits, these were our people from Sumgait. I was so frightened\\nthat I walked without knowing where was going, I couldn\\'t feel my legs or the \\nground under my feet. I was walking and there was a boy standing before my \\neyes. This was on the 27th, around evening time. He ran under our balcony, and\\nthe mob surged toward him shouting, \"He\\'s an Armenian, get him!\" He wore a \\nblack coat. They grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, I saw it. They \\ngrabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt.\\n\\nI made it home but I just couldn\\'t calm down. My oldest daughter was in my \\nthoughts. I was thinking, my daughter\\'s coming home now, they\\'ll stop her bus \\nand she\\'ll be gone. There\\'s no police, no protection, nothing. It\\'s like they \\nhad all died, there\\'s no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever. I can\\'t even\\nfind the words for it! I look and see an Ikarus arriving. Before going to the \\nbus station they stop near our place, across from the Kosmos movie theater. So\\nthis Ikarus stops  there and the gang is yelling, the Azerbaijanis are running\\ntoward it yelling, \"Armenians out!\" And I see them take the Armenians and beat\\nthem, killing them. I can\\'t watch it any more. It was a nightmare. I just \\ncouldn\\'t watch it. But Gaya was standing there watching it, and I scolded her.\\nShe says, \"Mamma, I have to see it, I have to know what\\'s happening, I have to\\nsee it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later. So our children \\nwill know.\"\\n\\nGayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th. They caught no less than 20 people\\nbefore my eyes. I can\\'t say for sure if they killed them or not . . .\\n\\n-Zinaida: There were too many people there, the mob was too big. You couldn\\'t \\nmake anything out. But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. He\\nwas 18 or 19 years old.\\n\\n-Gayane: I think he was older, probably, about 22. A tall fellow, a big guy, \\nin a coat. He was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was an\\nArmenian, he tore off running. And the mob went after him. They caught him \\nright under our balcony. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t think there could have been \\nmuch left of him after that. You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks\\none person. It was a mob, big, angry, and featureless. You know, there was a \\nsimilarity in the way they were dressed, mostly they were wearing long black \\ncoats. You couldn\\'t even tell them apart, they were all wearing black and they\\nall looked alike.\\n\\n-Zinaida: When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and \\nhe cried \"Mamma!\" I ran into the room. I couldn\\'t watch any longer. An awful \\nlot was going on right then, in various places, it wasn\\'t only that boy, \\nseveral people were being beaten up. You couldn\\'t see all of it at once, but \\nwhen that boy cried \"Mamma!\" I immediately started watching only him.\\n\\n-Gayane: On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until\\ntwelve at night. At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place.\\nThey were scattered about in all districts. But how can you explain the fact\\nthat by morning, when it had already started getting light, around seven\\no\\'clock, our police were gone? The police disappeared and yielded their\\npositions to the bandits. In the morning they started gathering at our inter-\\nsection again, at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. From\\nmorning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered, and by nine\\no\\'clock you couldn\\'t even see the ground. There were thousands of people in\\nthe crowd. Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians.\\n\\n-Zinaida: They had signals. I realized that when I noticed that they made a \\ncross with their arms, they crossed their arms over their heads. The cross,\\nevidently, meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it. They let the\\nAzerbaijani cars through, and they stopped the Armenian ones and started\\ntheir pogrom.\\n\\n-Gayane: They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his \\nnationality was. He got out and said they were from Baku. \"But what is your\\nnationality?\" He says Armenian. They immediately start shouting, \"Ermeni,\\nErmeni!\" And he says, \"What\\'s going on? I\\'m coming from Baku. I don\\'t live\\nin Sumgait.\" \"Doesn\\'t matter, who cares if you\\'re from Baku or Sumgait.\"\\nAnyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him, and they dragged a \\nwoman--his wife, probably--out of the car. At this point the police came and \\ntook the two and led them away. Then the mob started smashing the car, and \\nthen burned it. The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! Then everyone \\nran away, they thought the car was going to explode. About 20 minutes later \\nanother car comes along, a green Moskvich. They ran up shouting \"Ermeni! \\nErmeni!\" But this time they didn\\'t pull the people out of the car, they didn\\'t\\nbeat them. Maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged \\nfrom the flames. The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too, \\nacquaintances of his walked by below, and he asked them and they said, \"Yes, \\nthey burned them along with the car.\" About two hours later a whole wedding \\nprocession came by, and there was a doll on the first car. We thought they \\nwere Armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly. They were Azerbaijanis, \\nand they were immediately allowed through.\\n\\n-Zinaida: The driver waved his hand as if to say \\'get out of the way.\\' The\\nwhole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely.\\n\\n-Gayane: By the way, at the marriage hall, which is right in the courtyard\\nof our building, there was a wedding that day. The Azerbaijanis were cele-\\nbrating and dancing. On the streets there was grief and death, people were\\nbeing killed, and people were celebrating the whole time.\\n\\n-Zinaida: Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and \\nfind out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. She went to her \\ngirlfriend\\'s in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third \\nfloor. Gaya came back and said, \"Mamma, the bus is supposed to come around\\neight, after eight.\" You can imagine what I was feeling, how hard it was:\\nVika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death. \\nThen I heard shouting. I raced to the window and see that the belongings of \\nour neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. They were \\nthrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. I \\nstarted to cry. I am walking around the room, crying, wailing: Vika\\'s not \\nhere, what will come of her . . . Gaya, of course, was consoling me: \"Mamma, \\nnothing will happen to her, don\\'t worry, calm down, she\\'s in good company, \\nthey\\'ll look out for her.\"\\n\\nDiana: I saw the green car burn. The car was burning when we went out onto the\\nbalcony. Gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony. I left. Then \\nthey came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here.\\n\\n-Zinaida: You\\'re right, I forgot about that, that was on the 27th.\\n\\nDiana: There\\'s a small, grassy area in front of our balcony; there are trees\\nplanted there. The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building.\\nAll the neighbors said, no, there are no Armenians here. There weren\\'t a lot\\nof Armenians in our building, but there weren\\'t just a few Armenian families, \\neither.\\n\\n-Gayane: They fell upon the apartments on the 28th. There were terribly many \\nof them. Our courtyard is huge, and it was completely filled with them.\\n\\n-Zinaida: Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. He said that \\ntwo people, Azerbaijanis, had been killed in Karabagh. And when he said that \\n. . . you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz? It was like the \\nbuzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our \\ncourtyard, howling and shouting. I don\\'t know how to describe it. By this \\npoint we were afraid to watch from the balcony, but when I looked out of the \\nbedroom window--the Znaniye Bookstore is down there, and Armenians live on the \\nsecond and fourth floors--I saw their things being thrown out the windows. I \\nrealized that they would be upon us any minute. I shouted to Gayane, \"Gaya, \\nhide the gold.\" That\\'s honestly what I told my child. I grabbed Diana. I \\ndidn\\'t know what to do! Vika still wasn\\'t home, and it was already getting \\ndark. I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it \\nwas.\\n\\n-Gayane: Just in case, we changed the television channel from the Moscow \\nstation to the Azerbaijani one.\\n\\n-Zinaida: And turned it up loud.\\n\\n-Gayane: We never listened to Azerbaijani music. It just didn\\'t do much for \\nus. In all those years we almost never listened to it. But sometimes we would\\nwatch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television. And that was \\nit. And here we had it turned up full blast. So they would think we were \\nAzerbaijanis.\\n\\n-Zinaida: Well you can imagine, they\\'re slaughtering Armenians, robbing them, \\nand we\\'re listening to this concert music from Baku. Our Azerbaijani neighbors\\nsuggested we do it, they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on \\nAzerbaijani music. But we already had it on anyway. Turn on the lights, they \\ntold us, so they will think you\\'re not Armenians. They\\'re saying the Armenians\\nare afraid to turn on their lights, they\\'re hiding.\\n\\n-Gayane: Apparently there was some kind of arrangement, because we noticed \\nthat the lights were off only in Armenian apartments, that is, the \\nAzerbaijanis were warned, and every last one of them had their lights on.\\nWhen we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately, and\\nlater, another one. \"Turn on the lights,\" they told us, \"please. Nothing will\\nhappen. Be calm. Nothing will happen.\"\\n\\n-Zinaida: \"We won\\'t allow them to come into your apartment.\"\\n\\n-Gayane: We believed those people. We had never done anything bad to them.\\n\\n  -Zinaida: After the whole nightmare, about March 15, before we left for\\nArmenia, when I was coming into the building they were all crying. The\\nAzerbaijanis were crying, saying, \"Can it be there is no God? How could\\nthey raise their hands against your family? You never did anyone any harm,\\nyou never refused anyone anything, not in hard times, or in time of fortune,\\nor in time of mourning. How could they give you away? How could they sell you \\ndown the river?\" They really had given us away. Some of them protected us, but\\nothers gave us away. They sold us down the river.\\n\\n-Gayane: I was wearing slacks that day, and when it all began I became \\ncautious for some reason and I changed my clothes. Azerbaijani women don\\'t \\nwear pants. Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants, but the \\nAzerbaijanis found that very strange. And I thought I better put on a skirt, \\notherwise they won\\'t believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis. There was\\nnothing else we could do. No other way out. I was forced to turn myself into \\nGod knows who. I let my hair down, tousled it, and threw a scarf over my head.\\n\\n-Zinaida: And she told me, \"Mamma, you hide. Take Diana and go into the other \\nroom. You two look more like Armenians. They\\'ll figure out that we\\'re \\nArmenians right away.\" But how could I go away and leave her there?!\\n\\n-Gayane: I went out onto the balcony. It worked out better that way. We were \\nthe only Armenian family in the fourth entryway. This gave us hope: we were \\nthe only ones, the neighbors wouldn\\'t let them in. They, the Azerbaijanis, \\nwould fear for themselves and for their children. I looked and saw someone \\ncrawling up on the balcony from below, it was easy to get up onto our balcony.\\nWhen we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and \\nwe would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. So I turned around\\nand saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. He looks at me and shouts, \"What \\nnationality are you here?\"\\n\\n-Zinaida: At the same time they were knocking on the door.\\n\\n-Gayane: \"What nationality are you?\" he\\'s shouting. Well at first I was\\nfrightened, but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect \\nAzerbaijani, \"You should be ashamed of yourself, asking a question like that.\\nCan\\'t you see I\\'m an Azerbaijani? If I were an Armenian would I come out to \\nmeet you face to face and look you in the eyes?\" He looks at me and tells the\\npeople with him, \"Yes, Azerbaijanis live here.\" From below they tell him,\\n\"Check it out, it can\\'t be, they have to be Armenians.\" And he asks me again,\\n\"What nationality are you?\" I say, \"Can\\'t you see?\" I started fuming. I could\\nnot say anything else. \"You\\'re blind, that\\'s for sure! You can yell all you\\nwant, but that won\\'t make us Armenians.\" I hear them breaking down our\\ndoor, and Mamma went toward the door. I say, \"I don\\'t have time to deal\\nwith you, they\\'re breaking down our door.\" 1 go to the door and ask, \"Who is\\nit?\" They answer, \"Open up!\" I say, \"Wait, why are you breaking the door?\\nWhat\\'s going on? I\\'m opening up.\" We never locked the lower lock, it was\\nbroken, but now they had locked it out of fear, and I couldn\\'t get it open. I\\nsay wait, I\\'m looking for the key. I opened the door--it was almost broken\\ndown already. I opened the door and they burst in. I say, \"What\\'s going on?\\nWhy are you breaking down our door?\"\\n\\n-Zinaida: Then they started climbing in from the balcony. They\\'re shouting, \\n\"Why don\\'t you open the door?\" And I say, \"Well you\\'ve already come in the \\nbalcony.\" Then Diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes the\\ndoor. Gaya cries out, \"Mamma, Diana ran into the bathroom!\" I ran to the door \\nand forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis, and said in Armenian: \\n\"Diana, open the door!\" Gaya tried to calm them down, and I\\'m shouting with\\ntears in my eyes for Diana to open the door.\\n\\n-Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll, Little Red Riding Hood. That \\nguy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. They \\nput it up to Mamma\\'s stomach. I ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and \\nslammed it behind me. I was frightened, and started to cry. I shouted, \"Mamma,\\nthey want to kill you!\" And then . . . then they started shouting, \"Give us \\nyour passports.\" And Gaya says, \"What do you need passports for, we\\'re \\nAzerbaijanis.\"\\n\\n-Gayane: I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis, I was trying\\neverything I could, I could get on my knees and plead. I could humble myself, \\nbecause at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own. To be\\nhonest I didn\\'t care about anything else, as long as my little sister would \\nsurvive, her life and health had cost us so dearly! I tell them, \"What, don\\'t \\nyou understand anything?\" They started shouting, they were tremendously \\nexcited, shouting with terribly loud voices, saying that in Stepanakert their \\ngirls were being killed, raped, and tossed around with pitchforks. Why \\nshouldn\\'t they do the same to us? I said, \"Who\\'s doing all that? Who is doing \\nit? Some Armenians! What does that have to do with us? Give me the knife, I\\'ll\\ncut my own face.\" \"Now you calm down,\" they tell me.\\n\\nZinaida: I told them, \"Why didn\\'t you deal with them there! There, in \\nKarabakh? Nothing has happened here, no one has been fighting here, not we \\nwith the Armenians, nor they with us. Why didn\\'t you give it right back to\\nthem there? What\\'ve we got to do with this?\" I got confused. I had been\\nsaying that we were Azerbaijanis, but suddenly I started speaking as though\\nI were an Armenian, but they didn\\'t notice. One of them was next to me,\\nwith a knife at my breast. And he says to the others, \"What pretty girls.\" He\\nmeant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana. I was terrified. Gaya started assuring \\nthem that we were Azerbaijanis. One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad \\nlooks.\\n\\n-Gayane: He demanded the passports. I said, \"Young man, I don\\'t have my \\npassport here.\" He says, \"Let\\'s have the passport, we won\\'t believe you\\nwithout your passport.\" And one of them started hurriedly searching for\\ndocuments. They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down, took the \\npicture off the wall, and started pulling the clothes off their hooks, yelling\\nand shouting, \"Passport! Passport!\" They all started yelling, there was so \\nmuch noise in the apartment. They were all shouting. My hair stood on end. \\nSuddenly I said, \"Listen, my Papa died, 40 days haven\\'t passed yet, we have a \\nMuslim household, we\\'re in mourning, you should be ashamed of yourselves, \\nyou\\'ve disgraced your honor.\" And then Mamma started to cry.\\n\\n-Zinaida: I started crying: \"My husband died, 40 days haven\\'t yet passed,\\naren\\'t you ashamed of yourselves!\" In fact my husband had died seven years\\nearlier, in 1981. \"We\\'re in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu-\\nments. The documents are at the housing office, I\\'m filing for my pension.\"\\nWell it seemed like they believed us. Then one guy said, \"They\\'re Lezgins.\\nCan\\'t you see, there are no men here, only women. Leave.\" Another fellow in\\nthe group agreed with him, he also said that we were Lezgins. But a third\\nsaid, \"No, they\\'re Armenians.\" Well the other two convinced him, I don t know \\nhow, and all the rest of them listened to them too. There were about 50 of \\nthem, if not more, all in our three-room apartment, even the entryway was \\nfilled. They started leaving. Yes, we\\'re Lezgins, we\\'re Lezgins.\" They started\\nleaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him. And the one who had \\nfirst called us Lezgins says, \"Leave that, what are you doing?\" They seemed to\\nobey that guy.\\n\\n-Gayane: He was tall, wearing baggy jeans and a coat.\\n\\n-Zinaida: With a little moustache, I think.\\n\\n-Gayane: No, he didn\\'t have a moustache, he was tall with brown hair, he \\nwasn\\'t a bad-looking sort. He didn\\'t have anything in his hands.\\n\\n-Zinaida: He stood at the threshold.\\n\\n-Gayane: Yes, he didn\\'t look like a bad guy, and you know, his face seemed \\nfamiliar to me. I had seen him somewhere. And more than once. But I can\\'t \\nremember where. When he came in I was stupefied, I had a premonition that he \\nwouldn\\'t be able to remain indifferent. When he said that we were Lezgins and \\nthat they should leave, such gladness started to glow inside of me. Hope. They\\ncontinued to argue on their way out. Some said, \"They\\'re Armenians all the \\nsame.\" And that fellow answered, \"even if they are Armenians, it\\'s shameful,\\nthe father died, they\\'re mourning, there\\'s nothing but women in the house, \\nthere\\'s no men. We should stay out of the apartment.\" \"What do you mean, stay \\nout? We can go in there!\" And he said, \"No, we should stay out, they\\'re \\nLezgins, we\\'re leaving here.\" The three of them protected us.\\n\\n   -Zinaida: No, the two of them. The one in the short coat and the one in the\\ngrey suit, who stood at the threshold, about 19 or 20 years old. Well they\\nwere all young really. The two of them defended us.\\n\\n-Diana: Three, three!\\n\\n-Zinaida: Do you remember the third one, Diana?\\n\\n-Diana: Yes, he was wearing dark clothes.\\n\\n-Gayane: The third one was the one who came back. He wore a long brown coat.\\n\\n-Diana: He wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too. When \\nthey left, they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians, and ran \\nback and said that they were going to kill us.\\n\\n-Zinaida: They had all left, and we had started to calm down a little, and I\\nclosed the door. And then there is a knock. I told Gaya, \"Take Diana and go\\ninto the other room.\" My daughters went into the dining room, and I opened the\\ndoor. There was a guy there who said, \"Run, hide! They\\'re coming to kill you \\nnow!\" We ran up to the third floor. We had some good neighbors up there,\\nAzerbaijanis. I sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do. \\nI was so far gone . . . Out of a whole room I couldn\\'t even think of anything \\nto take. I even forgot to take my work documents; at the time I had been \\npreparing a report to send to Baku, and the documents were at home. I couldn\\'t\\nsee anything . . . I could only see Vika, my older daughter. I sent Gaya and \\nDiana upstairs, and stood there asking that fellow, \"Should I close the door \\nand leave everything like this?\" He says, \"What do you mean, door? Get out of \\nhere, they\\'re coming to kill you! What are you standing there for?\" And I ran \\nafter the children.\\n\\n-Gayane: We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into \\nour apartment and started shouting, \"Where are the Armenians?\" We were already\\nat the neighbors\\'. They had an infant at the time, and the neighbor said, \\n\"Don\\'t you worry, I\\'m not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what.\"\\n\\n-Zinaida: On the third floor there I started asking the folks, our neighbors,\\nto go meet Vika. The bus was due to arrive at eight o\\'clock. I dissolved in\\ntears, Gaya was soothing me, Diana was next to us, she was crying too, and I\\'m\\nalready thinking that I\\'ve lost my older daughter, but deep in my heart I \\nstill believe she\\'s alive . . . And my tears choked me. I was going out of my\\nmind. But no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed with\\npeople, swarming with them. From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment \\nwe were hiding asked the bandits, \"Where are those Armenians, the ones who \\nwere at home? Where did they make off to?\" They told him they didn\\'t know. \\nThey asked him where he lived. He answered, \"Can\\'t you see, on the third \\nfloor.\" He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. We\\nheard them taking free reign of our apartment, and they threw our color \\ntelevision off the balcony and it exploded.\\n\\n-Gayane: Mamma was crying the whole time. She fell into a faint and we brought\\nher around and held her back, because the whole time she kept making for the \\ndoor to go outside, alternately raving and sobbing, shouting, and calling \\nVika. She didn\\'t notice us, probably because we were next to her. Her thoughts\\nwere only on Vika. The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too, \\noffering tea.\\n\\n-Zinaida: We are very grateful to them. Thanks to them my children and I are\\nalive, well, and unharmed. When they were throwing our belongings out and \\nburning them--the beds, the pillows, and the chairs--our neighbor came to us \\nand said, \"How lucky you are that it\\'s not you standing there naked, but some \\nother woman instead. You\\'re from our part of the building you lost your \\nhusband, you have children, thank God you\\'re not in her position, we wouldn\\'t \\nhave been able to take it. I don\\'t know what I would do.\" He of course \\nwouldn\\'t have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down. In the yard \\nthey were torturing our neighbors, fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth \\nfloor, in the third entryway. A married couple, Vanya and Nina, and their \\nthree children. Their last name is V. They hid their two daughters, and stayed\\nwith their son to defend themselves, they even got boiling water ready, and an\\naxe, and held them off for a long time, but the . . . They beat up the \\nhusband, dragged the wife outside, and stood her naked next to our burning \\nthings; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. The crowd shouted, \\n\"Look at the naked Armenian!\" They were going to throw the poor woman into the\\nfire. The neighbors came out, an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf, and she \\ncovered herself with it, and the neighbors led her off to their apartment. \\nAll the neighbors saw and heard it . . .\\n\\n-Gayane: Mamma wouldn\\'t allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing\\nthere, and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them \\ninto her body. Our neighbor, who lived in the same entryway as Nina--she \\nlives with us in the same boarding house now--saw what they had done, Nina \\nshowed her, from her knees up, almost up to her neck, her whole body was \\ncovered, riddled, with wounds.\\n\\n-Zinaida: In the morning, during the night of the 29th, rather, after one\\no\\'clock, two buses approached the station. I wanted to run out. By then I\\ndidn\\'t care any more if I lived or died, but Gayane wouldn\\'t let me go, and\\nthe neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be\\nslain along with their children. Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about\\nthem, my other children, but I could only think of Vika. I imagined her torn\\nto pieces, I\\'m a mother, and they\\'re just children, they don\\'t understand I\\nwould have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. I was\\ngoing to do it but Gayane wouldn\\'t let me: \"Mamma, please! Mamma, I beg of \\nyou!\" The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries. So we \\nheld on that way till morning.\\n\\nOn the morning of the 29th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to\\nour apartment, maybe Vika was lying there, murdered. He told me he would go \\nhimself. He was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity to\\nme. He returned and said there was no one there, nothing. I went down too, \\nstole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about. I \\ndidn\\'t go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far \\naway, farther than the bus station. I began looking for the briefcase with my \\nwork in it. I was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time \\nbecause of my work. My documents were there, my travel papers--I worked in the\\ntransport division -- and my trip sheets.\\n\\n-Gayane: Mamma is a very responsible person, she was always ready to work \\naround the clock to do her job.\\n\\n-Zinaida: I look around and I can\\'t find the briefcase. I didn\\'t care about \\nthe fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms, that\\neverything was smashed, and the furniture was broken, I worried about that\\nlater, but at first I was concerned about the lost documents. I went into the\\nkitchen. My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and \\nmy earrings. It was all there. Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said,\\n\"Mamma, hurry.\" And Diana came downstairs too. Gayane found  her coat among \\nthe debris, and Diana found her track shoes, her coat, and some of her \\ndresses.\\n\\n-Diana: Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started \\nthrowing things around in the apartment under us. They threw a television onto\\nthe asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. Then, \\nwhen Vika wasn\\'t there, I wouldn\\'t eat, and they forced me, but I couldn\\'t \\neat. Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies\\nand gone for walks in the park. When we went into our apartment the next day \\nand everything was broken, right away I started looking for my dolls and my \\nbooks, but I didn\\'t see anything. When we went back upstairs I managed to take\\ntwo cups from my tea service, and Gaya took Vika\\'s suit and one of her own \\ndresses. My Italian boots were gone, my brown coat, it was beautiful, there \\nwasn\\'t a one of my beautiful dolls, and my giant lion was gone too, the one \\nthat had been on top of the television. He was very large and very handsome. \\nI had two satchels, one for first grade and the other for second grade, one \\nwas yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it, they\\'re playing a drum and a \\nviolin, and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears, and on the other \\none were the letters A, B, C, D, E and the numbers 4+5, two girls and a boy \\nwith their mouths open like they are singing. They were beautiful satchels. \\nThey were gone too. I had many books, I collected them, they were in the \\nbedside tables. And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my \\nbirthday, they weren\\'t around either. And I had some big books, fat ones, and \\nthey disappeared, only one was left, The Malachite Box. The Adventures of \\nKarlson, Pippi Longstockings, and Fairy Tales of the World were left. All the \\nother books were gone.\\n\\n-Zinaida: I continued searching for my briefcase, and then my supervisor\\narrived. He had waited for me until nine o\\'clock, but I didn\\'t appear, and he\\nthought something must have happened, so he came. He\\'s a Russian, Aleksei \\nSemyonovich Lomakin. Alik Aliyev, the mechanic, came with him. When they saw \\nmy wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing. \\nWhen I saw them I started crying. My Azerbaijani neighbors came in. Some of \\nthem were crying, others were helping me pick up. I go on looking for my \\ndocuments and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. Now that I \\nremember it it\\'s both funny and painful: How could I have thought that I had \\nreturned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal? \\nIncidentally, later, when I went back to the apartment again those things were\\ngone too. And the door was gone. After my supervisor left, in the afternoon, \\nthe neighbor said that we should leave, find another refuge. \"I\\'m afraid,\" he \\nsaid, \"that someone saw you come to my apartment, and that they could kill you\\nand us too. My God, where could I go it was daytime and those . . . I don\\'t \\neven know what to call them, the bandits, those marauders, those jackals, I \\ndon\\'t know what to call them, I can\\'t find the words, they were everywhere. \\nWhere should I go with two girls? When I opened the door I had tears in my \\neyes, and I was terrified . . . And he said, \"Go to Alik\\'s, he\\'s an\\nAzerbaijani, too.\" and I say, \"You should have said that earlier, when my \\nsupervisor was here with the car, he could have taken us with him.\" Everyone \\nfeared for their own lives. What could I do? I went out into the entryway and \\nstood. And he says, \"any other time I would keep you here a year, or two. But \\nright now, I\\'m sorry . . . \" Then another door opened, also on the third \\nfloor. I ask the neighbor, \"Tayara, can we hide at your place?\" She\\'s an \\nAzerbaijani too. She says, \"What kind of question is that? Come in!\" She hid \\nus. There were many people in the courtyard, and Gaya and I hid in the \\nwardrobe, and they put Diana under a mattress, leaving a small opening so the \\nchild could breathe. Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us \\nout, and when they came back she would hide us again.\\n\\nWe sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. Gaya became ill, and I allowed \\nher to get out. My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. We hadn\\'t eaten or \\ndrunk anything for so long, since the 27th, when we saw that horror--and all \\nof it just snapped in me. Tayara\\'s husband went outside, even though I begged \\nhim to stay, saying there should be a man in the house. He said that he\\'d be \\nin the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him. She put \\nher passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came \\nin she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family. My girls went to \\nthe window--and what was going on out there! I feared for my children, that \\nsomeone would recognize them from the street. Gaya let her hair down and put \\non a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani, but directly across there was\\na 9-story building, their windows were right across from us, and I shouted \\nthat someone would see her and give us away on the spot. But she kept on \\nlooking.\\n\\n-Diana: I watched too.\\n\\n-Zinaida: Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. The soldiers\\ndidn\\'t shoot, they didn\\'t have orders to. I saw them throwing rocks at\\nthe soldiers, they were young boys, 18- and 19-year olds, and they defended\\nthemselves . . . I\\'m a mother after all, and they were no different from my\\nchildren. When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to\\nstop looking, l couldn\\'t watch anymore . . . I imagined my children in their\\nshoes . . .\\n\\n-Gayane: The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned \\noff the buildings, and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station, Block \\n36, and our Microdistrict 3. But they only cordoned them off from the outside.\\nThe mob fell upon the soldiers, who started to protect themselves, and the mob\\nsurged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. They caught several \\nAzerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. One fell down and they\\ncracked open another\\'s head . . .\\n\\n-Zinaida: They show Lebanon on television, and the war in Afghanistan--that\\'s just\\nwhat it was like. Like in America, how they attack demonstrations with shields\\nand clubs--that\\'s just how it was in our courtyard.\\n\\n-Gayane: Don\\'t compare it with America, those were peaceful demonstrations, \\nbut these?!\\n\\n-Zinaida: But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America! They \\nattacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them . . . Then I thought, where\\'s the\\ntear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators? If they had used \\ngas on those jackals they all would have scattered.\\n\\n-Gayane: They would not have scattered. The soldiers had been there since \\nmorning, they didn\\'t bring in fresh troops. They hadn\\'t eaten, they were fine \\nstanding there for about three hours, but then they got tired. They weren\\'t \\neven allowed to sit down . . . At noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and \\nthen the tables were turned. The mob went after the soldiers, the guys were \\nbunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their \\nshields, and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them.\\nAnd those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. And meanwhile\\ntanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . They always say, \"Our \\nchildren have never seen war.\" I never even dreamed about it, there was no \\nneed to. But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war. It\\nwas truly horrible . . . The guys were tired, exhausted, some had had their \\nclubs taken away, others, their shields, they had been beaten, they were \\ncovered in blood . . . so many died! They beat the soldiers with their own \\nclubs and shields. And those guys stood there and couldn\\'t defend themselves, \\nthey couldn\\'t open fire. They couldn\\'t even defend themselves, let alone us. \\nIt\\'s comical . . .\\n\\n-Zinaida: What are you saying? How can it be funny?\\n\\n-Gayane: No, I didn\\'t mean that: How could something like that happen during \\nour Soviet period? It\\'s painfully embarrassing! And they burned the armored \\npersonnel carriers, too. Someone shouted, \"Get away, it\\'s going to blow!\" \\nEveryone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded. The \\nsoldiers lost their senses. And when they drove the personnel carrier and the \\nbus at the mob out of rage and fury, they drove right up on the sidewalk.\\n\\n-Zinaida: The bus that had brought the troops. Only the driver was in it. The \\nbus ran over three people straight off, I saw it. And two armored personnel \\ncarriers ran over four more. All in one or two minutes. The bus ran over \\nthree, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more. Right on \\nour street there\\'s a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places; one \\nof the armored personnel carriers went that way, and they say it ran over\\nseveral over there, too. But they ran over seven before our eyes. Then the bus\\nploughed into a book kiosk.\\n\\n-Gayane: No, that was a flower place. It was a new booth. He drove straight \\ninto it.\\n\\n-Zinaida: The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the\\nmiddle of the road and set it on fire.\\n\\n-Gayane: And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and \\ntake them in a convoy to Baku. There were many arrests.\\n\\n-Zinaida: Our neighbor, the one who hid us, couldn\\'t take it, and he told his \\nwife that we should leave. They were running around in the courtyard looking \\nfor the Armenians. They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis, and they\\nwere saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families. Poor \\nTayara got scared too, and started to cry; I pleaded with her, I said that I \\nwould remember forever how she saved my children and me, but where could we \\ngo?\\n\\n-Gayane: She didn\\'t make us leave, she said that she would do anything, but \\nshe was afraid.\\n\\n-Zinaida: I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at\\nnight we would return to our apartment. Then her husband came back and said \\nthat a curfew had been imposed. He says, \"Zina, you owe us a drink. Gorbachev \\nannounced a curfew.\" And Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of \\nAzerbaijan SSR] was on television, he said that two people had been killed in \\nKarabagh, but nothing was wrong, automobile windows had been broken, but there\\nhadn\\'t been any killings. He kept making statements, and there were \\nAzerbaijani songs and dances. Tayara turned the TV all the way up. When we \\nlearned of the curfew we calmed down, but then a crowd ran into the courtyard \\nagain, a large one. Our neighbor told them that there had been only one \\nArmenian family here, but they had already killed them all, there was no one \\nleft. We hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck Diana back under the bed.\\n\\n-Gayane: Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there, and\\nfound two bandits. They asked her, \"What are you doing here\" Tayara answered, \\n\"I came to take something for myself.\" \"Take all you want, they\\'re gone now.\" \\n\\n-Zinaida: Yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding. \\nShe said, \"What are you going to do, empty handed, naked, with three children,\\nnothing remains of your entire apartment.\" In short, we calmed down, and the \\ncrowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us. I don\\'t know \\nwhat went on there.\\n\\n-Gayane: The curfew had its effect on the gangs, many started to disperse:\\nthey were warned that they would open fire on them. The soldiers didn\\'t know \\nthe city, they couldn\\'t get oriented, they drove up and down the main streets,\\nbut didn\\'t go into the courtyards. When we were at the City Party Committee \\nthey asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way.\\n\\n-Zinaida: The tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th.\\n\\n-Gayane: No, Mamma, the tanks had been there earlier, but were near the City \\nParty Committee, where the Armenians were . . . After midnight, on March 1, \\nwhen I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights, Mamma said, \\n\"Get your things together, they have sent buses for us.\" As it was we had been\\ndressed the entire time. Mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us.\\n\\n-Zinaida: When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive \\nand well, some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe \\nplace. I both believed it and didn\\'t believe it. We ran out to the tanks. The \\nGambarians were there, Roman and Sasha; their father, Shurik, the clarinetist,\\nwas killed, and their mother was there. Sasha came over and asked about the \\ngirls. I was surprised, how did he know my girls? He said that he knew me and \\nthe girls. Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he \\nwas taking forever so I went after him. Another neighbor came out, Anna \\nVasilyevna, a Russian: \"Zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck.\" She kissed \\nDiana. They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be \\ntaken to the City Party Committee. The bus wouldn\\'t start, so they put us on \\nanother one. It was pouring rain.\\n\\n-Diana: When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets, \\nand they all had clubs and shields. And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them, \\nmany of the soldiers died. They threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the \\nsoldiers. I saw this myself. The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with the\\ntanks. The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people \\nand they ran over them out of rage. We got scared and they hid me under a \\nmattress and a blanket, and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe. And they\\nwere fighting right down there on the street . . . Near the building they were\\nblowing up buses and tanks, and cars were burning, and there were many dead in\\nthe courtyard. They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a \\nstreet, they just drove, and the ones who didn\\'t manage to get out of the way \\nwere run over by the tanks. And when we left--it was evening, it was already \\ndark--there were three buses, and one of them had soldiers in it. Mamma ran up\\nand said, \"Get your clothes on, let\\'s go.\" Gaya was wearing slippers, and I \\nhad on my blue dress, but it was an old one. I was wearing my old jacket, my \\nold dress, and slippers. And nothing else. Gaya had on a skirt, her Angora \\nsweater, and slippers. It was raining hard, and there were puddles on the \\nstreet. They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved \\ndress; she put it on and we ran out. We got onto the bus and I was hungry, one\\nof the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to\\nthe other in his arms. I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika\\'s\\ntrousseau, and he gave me his telephone number.\\n\\n-Gayane: In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window.\\nWe had to be ready for anything. They took us to the City Party Committee, let\\nus out, and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed \\nguard. It was jammed with people and you couldn\\'t breathe. We asked, \"Are \\nthese all us? Armenians?\" They answered yes. We were surprised that there were\\nso many Armenians in Sumgait. All those years we lived there and didn\\'t know \\nthere were so many Armenians, 18,000. We were struck by that, we had never \\nnoticed. Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the \\nKomsomol from Vika\\'s plant, the Khimprom. He said that Vika was alive and \\nwell. When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more. But you know, \\nafter all that it was hard to believe anything, our faith in everything was \\njust gone. She didn\\'t believe it completely.\\n\\n-Zinaida: I didn\\'t believe it because I had heard all kinds of things. When\\nwe arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable! It\\nwas the fear of God. I saw many of our acquaintances, they were kissing each \\nother and asking how their children and homes were. Many people already knew \\nthat there had been a pogrom of our apartment. They had seen the broken \\nwindows. I cried, saying that I didn\\'t know where Vika was. One woman said \\nthat they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn\\'t find one of \\nthem; the other had been slashed all over. A second said that her husband and\\nher son had been murdered. That was Nelli Aramian. She lived in Building 6 in \\nour microdistrict. They killed her husband, Armo, and her son Artur. I heard \\nso many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch; my \\npatience had run dry waiting for my daughter. Later an Azerbaijani fellow came\\nto me and said, Aunt Zina, Vika sent me, she\\'s alive and well and hidden in a \\nsafe place; if you want I\\'ll call her there and you can speak with her. We \\nwent downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika. I spoke with her, heard\\nthe voice of my child. She had managed to survive in that hell. Then I started\\nbegging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee. He tried to\\ntalk me out of it: \"I\\'ll bring her wherever you go, don\\'t worry, I\\'ve looked \\nafter her better than a brother does a sister.\" All the same I asked him to \\nget her. He brought her and I calmed down. On the second day there was a \\nmeeting with Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the\\nCommunist Party of the USSR,] and people started shouting. One shouted, \"Give \\nme my son back!\", another yelled, \"Where is my daughter?!\", a third wanted her\\nhusband . . . Bagirov  was there too, and he stood there blinking, not saying \\nanything.\\n\\n-Gayane: When Demichev asked where we wanted to go, everyone shouted, \"To\\nRussia!\" To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia, there were such wild \\nrumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream, and no one wanted to go \\nto Armenia. But he said that he couldn\\'t evacuate 18,000 people to Russia and \\nthat he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with \\nthem. And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our \\napartments. On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of \\nNasosny. We were taken care of marvelously by the military. They sent special \\nflights of children right from there to Minvody, Yerevan, and Moscow. One \\nwoman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Gromyko.\\n\\n-Zinaida: The worst was truly behind us by then. Everything had passed, but \\nthe pain will remain for our whole lives. It cannot be forgotten. Under no \\ncircumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget. Who will\\nanswer for those who died? For our mothers, sisters, brother, sons and\\ndaughters? Who will bear the responsibility? Who will wash away their blood? \\nSomeone should be made to answer, and severely, so it has an effect on the \\npeople that did with us as they pleased . . . It isn\\'t over yet, now we live \\nhere, in Armenia, protected, but the issue isn\\'t resolved. We would like\\nto stay in Armenia, in our homeland, so that all the Armenian people will be\\nunited. Then we will be invincible. Armenians won\\'t be scattered throughout \\nthe Soviet Union, about the world, and if we\\'re all together this won\\'t happen\\nagain. As a mother of three children, as a woman, as a sister, I ask Armenians\\nto be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen again. Our \\nhomeland . . . The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an \\napartment and getting jobs. So that our children can work for the good of \\nArmenia. If we aren\\'t able to, then let our children do it. And if it\\'s \\npossible, we\\'ll work for the good of Armenia too. This is the land of our \\nforefathers. Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived here too, it was \\nonly later that people dispersed all over. Like a mother, the land here bore \\nand reared us. It is our wife, and will protect us, too. I want but one thing:\\nthat our people never see the hardship that our children saw, that your \\nchildren here, in Armenia, never see anything like it.\\n\\n  May 28, 1988\\n  Yerevan\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Their hope was their participation in the Russian\\n success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of\\n Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common\\n soldiers began deserting in droves.\"\\n\\n\"With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of\\n World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman\\'s enemy\\n increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,\\n Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn\\n massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of\\n expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.\"\\n\\n\"...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final\\n plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the \\n president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response:\\n\\n \\'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the \\n  glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian\\n  arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the\\n  Bosporus.

A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\\n\\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\\nduring the same terrible event.\\n\\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\\nAyshe\\'s  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\\nheard one of the Major\\'s children moan, then I fainted.\\n\\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\\nbrutally murdered.\\n\\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\\nunder the double-bed.\\n\\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\\nwere all wounded.\\n\\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o\\'clock in  the morning.  I\\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\\n\\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\\nAyshe and her daughter.\\n\\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\\n\\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\\ndetention. They then released me.\"\\n\\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS\\'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\\n\\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\\ndays.\\n\\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\\nterrible sights.\\n\\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\\nchild\\'s bicycle lay in a corner.\\n\\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\\n\\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\\nhead.\\n\\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\\n\\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\\n\\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \"DAILY EXPRESS\")\\n\\n\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\"\\n\\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n'),\n",

O\\'Keefe\\n\\n\\nHARD BY THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT, within clear view of the Jefferson\\nMemorial, an easy stroll down the Mall to the majestic Lincoln Memorial,\\nhas arisen, on some of the most hallowed territory of the United States of\\nAmerica, a costly and dangerous mistake.  On ground where no monument yet\\nmarks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of Americans of all\\nraces and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today a\\nmassive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and false\\nversion of the ordeal in Europe during World War II, of non-American\\nmembers of a minority, sectarian group.  Now, in the deceptive guise of\\ntolerance, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum begins a propaganda\\ncampaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the American taxpayer,\\nin the interests of Israel and its adherents in America.\\n\\n     How did the federal government allow the creation of such a\\nmonstrosity?  What is its meaning for American policy and for American\\nvalues?  And what must the American people do to regain control of the land\\ntheir servants in Washington handed over to a foreign interest and to\\nestablish an enterprise thereon, whether a museum or otherwise, informed by\\nand conducted according to American principles and interests?\\n\\n[Photograph captioned, \"The five-story, $150 million US Holocaust Memorial\\nMuseum in Washington, D.C. was built and is operated by a taxpayer-funded\\nfederal agency.  In the foreground is the museum\\'s six-sided \"Hall of\\nRemembrance.\"\\n\\n\\nORIGINS\\n\\n     In the late 1970s, during the presidency of James Earl \"Jimmy\" Carter,\\na propaganda campaign to promote the \"Holocaust,\" the alleged systematic\\nslaughter of some 6 million Jews by the Germans during World War II, was\\norganized and carried out from Hollywood and New York. As Benjamin Meed, an\\nimportant functionary of the council which controls the Holocaust museum,\\nwrote in 1990:\\n              \\n\\n          Almost a dozen years ago, a new phenomena [sic] developed.  The\\n     Holocaust was introduced into schools, colleges, and universities.\\n     Television broadcast programs on the Holocaust and millions of\\n     Americans watched them.  Soon, Americans took great interest in the\\n     lessons of the Holocaust, its uniqueness and its universal message.(1)\\n\\n\\n     Why the urgency of this campaign? Two factors were paramount:  first,\\nthe beginnings, more than three decades after the end of World War II, of\\nan objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged German policy\\nto exterminate European Jewry.(2)\\n\\n     Second, the need to justify Zionist theory and practice in the face of\\nunprecedented international resistance to Israeli intransigence (including\\nthe famous UN General Assembly Resolution which equated Zionism with\\nracism), and to defend Israel\\'s aggressive policy under the leadership of\\nthe former terrorist, Prime Minister Menachem Begin.(3)\\n\\n\\nTHE U.S. HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL COUNCIL\\n\\n     In 1978 President Carter, his administration beleaguered at home and\\nabroad, succumbed to pressure from the new \"Holocaust\" lobby (and thus\\nAmerica\\'s influential Israel-first minority) by creating, through executive\\norder, the President\\'s Commission on the Holocaust.  Two years later, on\\nOctober 7, 1988, Congress passed--unanimously--a law establishing the\\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Council, charged principally with\\nconstructing and overseeing the operation of \"a permanent living memorial\\nto the victims of the holocaust\" and with providing \"for appropriate ways\\nfor the Nation to commemorate the Days of Remembrance, as an annual,\\nnational, civic commemoration of the Holocaust...\"(4)\\n\\n     A priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council, and,\\nafter years of costly delay (during which the U.S. Holocaust Memorial\\nCouncil\\'s budget swelled from $2.5 million to over $18 million a year), the\\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has been completed and readied for opening\\non April 22, 1993.\\n\\n\\nA SECTARIAN, ALIEN AGENDA\\n\\n     The Holocaust Memorial Council, besides soliciting tens of millions of\\ndollars in tax-deductible donations to finance the Holocaust museum, has\\nbusied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority,\\nZionist ends.\\n\\n     The membership of the council, a U.S. federal agency, has been\\noverwhelmingly Jewish since its founding in 1980.  The council\\'s two\\ndifferent chairmen--Elie Wiesel and Harvey Meyerhoff--have both been\\ncommitted to the support of the state of Israel, and the chairs of the\\ncouncil\\'s most important committees have been likewise Jewish and Zionist.\\n\\n     The chief fundraiser for the Holocaust museum, Miles Lerman, was\\nformerly American vice chairman for the State of Israel Bonds Organization,\\npromoting tax-free investment in a country which receives by far the\\nlargest amount of U.S. foreign aid per year.  Working the same wealthy\\nJewish Americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for Israel,\\nLerman has helped raise nearly $160 million in tax-deductible\\ncontributions.  The biggest donors have been rewarded by having various\\ncomponents of the museum named for them, e.g. the Wexler Learning Center.\\n\\n     Nor is erecting and operating the Holocaust Memorial Museum the only\\nfunction with which the Holocaust Memorial Council has been charged.\\nAnother of its duties is to commemorate the Days of Remembrance for Victims\\nof the Holocaust, which Congress has raised to \"an annual, national, civic\\ncommemoration of the Holocaust.\"  Like the Israeli Yom Hashoah (Day of the\\nHolocaust), on which they are based, the Days of Remembrance are dated\\naccording to the lunar Hebrew calendar, and thus like Passover or Chanukah,\\nfluctuate from year to year. These foreign days of lamentation are\\ncurrently celebrated, under the flag of the republic, to prayers and chants\\nin Hebrew, in governmental settings from the Capital Rotunda to city halls,\\nacross the land.  Need it be stated that no group of American victims of\\npersecution, let alone another foreign group, enjoys any such federally\\nmandated and tax-supported day, or days, of recognition?\\n\\n\\nTHE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM\\'S ONE-SIDED \"HISTORY\"\\n\\n     Although the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council during its early years\\nmade noises about recognizing the ordeals of non-Jews during World War II,\\nby every indication from advance literature published by the council, the\\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is relentlessly Judeocentric.  While,\\naccording to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit, here and\\nthere are nods to non-Jewish groups oppressed by the German National\\nSocialists (never to groups victimized by Germany\\'s enemies, above all by\\nStalin\\'s USSR), the larger holocaust of World War II, which claimed an\\nestimated 75 to 80 million lives around the world, is ignored in preference\\nto the Jewish ordeal. Thus, to cite just one telling example, the museum\\'s\\n\"Life before the Holocaust\" exhibit refers strictly to *Jewish* life before\\nthe Holocaust.(5)\\n\\n     Where, in fact, non-Jews figure in the Museum, they figure largely as\\nvillains: the Germans and their allies and collaborators; the Western\\nAllies, including America, who refused to accept a large immigration before\\nthe war; the American political and military leaders who refused to\\nauthorize costly bombing raids on the Auschwitz \"gas chambers.\"\\n\\n        \\nRED LIBERATORS?\\n\\n     The museum\\'s message that support for Jews is the sole measure of\\ndecency during World War II leads to anomalies which, in an American museum\\nraised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which this\\nrepublic is based, can only be called shocking.  That the victims of World\\nWar II atrocities by the Allies--massacres such as the fire-bombing of\\nTokyo and Dresden, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet\\nslaughter of their Polish prisoners at Katyn, the mass rapes carried out by\\nthe Red Army at the war\\'s end--receive no mention is deplorable.  But the\\nmuseum\\'s treatment of the armed forces which defended Stalin\\'s savage\\nSoviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque.\\n\\n     In the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Communists appear only in the\\nguise of \"resistance fighters\" and \"liberators.\"  For example, the\\nsubmachine gun and false papers of Samuel Weissberg, a Communist Party\\nmember who rose to high rank in a Communist guerrilla group in North\\nFrance, are on honored display, no less precious a relic than the standard\\nheaps of shoes and hair, in the museum\\'s permanent exhibit.(6)\\n\\n     Even more unsettling is the honor given to Stalin\\'s notorious Red\\nArmy, which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities across\\nEurope during, and after, the war.  As the U.S. Holocaust Memorial\\nCouncil\\'s newsletter fulsomely puts it, \"Flags will hang in the museum to\\nhonor the millions of Soviet soldiers who drove Nazi forces westward and\\nwho were the first Allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence of\\nthe camps.\"  In the words of Council chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, these\\nmartial banners of the Red tyranny have a single association: \"Much more\\nthan simply wartime memorabilia, these military artifacts are a significant\\ncontribution to memory, one that will remind future generations of the\\npivotal role Soviet forces played in defeating Nazism...\"(7)\\n\\n     What must the millions of Americans originating or descending from the\\nEuropean nations--Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,\\nPoland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, [former] Yugoslavia--\\nfor which the Red \"military artifacts\" symbolized invasion, tyranny,\\noppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armies\\nof *their* persecutors hailed as \"liberators\"?\\n\\n\\nISRAEL IN THE MUSEUM\\n\\n     Just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum\\'s\\ndirector, Yeshayahu Weinberg, and the head of its \"Learning Center,\"\\nYechiam Halevy, were brought in from Israel, the museum\\'s treatment of the\\nstate of Israel is adulatory.  An emotive tribute to the founding of Israel\\nis an integral part of the exhibition.  That the establishment of Israel,\\nand its expansion in subsequent wars, has meant colonial occupation and\\noppression for millions of the land\\'s native Palestinians, and\\ndispossession and exile for millions more, goes unmentioned--another\\ngrotesquery in an American museum supposed to instruct in the dangers of\\nintolerance and disregard of human rights.  As for the momentous\\ncollaboration between Hitler\\'s German state and the Jewish Agency in the\\n1930s, which through the Ha\\'avara Agreement enabled the transfer of vital\\ncapital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled Jewish\\nimmigrants to Palestine, that is passed over in utter silence.(8)\\n\\n\\n\"HISTORICAL CORRECTNESS\"\\n\\n     The Holocaust Museum\\'s skewed history is not simply a matter of one-\\nsidedness and omission.  The museum has further committed itself to a fixed\\nand final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspect\\nevidence for a German policy of annihilating European Jewry, largely in gas\\nchambers, in numbers approaching 6 million.  This despite a considerable\\nbody of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decades\\nin many lands, and which contests, by academic means, the substance of the\\nHolocaust \"extermination thesis.\"(9)\\n\\n     That the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council is aware of the work of the\\nrevisionists is clear: The council\\'s literature is replete, not with\\nsubstantive refutations of revisionist scholarship, but with slander and\\npolemic.  To cite one characteristic example, the _U.S. Holocaust Memorial\\nMuseum Newsletter_ of May, 1992 featured a front-page attack on Holocaust\\nrevisionism by Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Occidental College in which\\nthe author decried the revisionists for producing material that looked\\nscholarly, then lauded the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum as \"among the\\nmost efficacious ways\" of \"combating this pernicious trend,\" *while\\nneglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship.*(10)\\n\\n     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council recognizes that there is a\\nhistorical debate on the holocaust, but takes official notice of the\\ndissenting position only to attack it.  That an American institution,\\nsupported by the taxes of all Americans, should commit itself to inflexible\\nhistorical orthodoxy--in the service of a single American minority--is an\\nintolerable imposition on our First Amendment rights, as well as a mockery\\nof the Western, and American, ideal of objective scholarship.\\n\\n\\nA CENTER FOR EDUCATION?\\n\\n     U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff has stated:\\n\"The museum is primarily an educational institution.\"(11)  From the\\ncouncil\\'s own literature, however, it is clear what Meyerhoff means by\\neducation.  The \"role-playing\" for children as well as adults who visit the\\nmuseum (visitors are to be issued \"identity cards\" bearing the name and\\nalleged fate of various Holocaust victims); the high-tech computer and\\nvideo effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment the\\nmuseum\\'s tendentiously described artifacts; and the museum\\'s goal, as\\nproclaimed by its Zionist fundraising chairman, Miles Lerman, of ensuring\\nthat \"Children in Dubuque, families in Tucson, and schoolteachers in\\nAtlanta will learn the history and the lessons of Auschwitz as thoroughly\\nas they learn the history of their own communities\"--all these show that\\nthe U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is a *propaganda* enterprise that seeks\\nto indoctrinate all Americans in a uniquely and partisanly Jewish (and\\nZionist) version of not merely the past, but the present and the\\nfuture.(12)\\n\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN RESPONSE\\n\\n     What is the American response to a partisan museum constructed in a\\nplace solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic, to\\nbe lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when, even in our\\ncountry\\'s capital, thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our national\\nmonuments?  What is the American response to an ambitious propaganda agenda\\nthat aims to impose a sectarian \"Holocaust remembrance\" in schools where\\nour children cannot pray, in town halls and federal buildings from which\\nthe religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom of\\nworship?\\n\\n     Over two centuries ago, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \"To compel a man to\\nfurnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he\\ndisbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical.\"(13)\\n\\n     Nearly 150 years ago, Abraham Lincoln said: \"I insist that if there is\\n*anything* which it is the duty of the *whole people* to never entrust to\\nany hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of\\ntheir own liberties and institutions.\"(14)\\n\\n     The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the council which runs it, as\\nagencies of the government in which the American people is sovereign, must\\nbe removed from the special interest that now controls it.\\n\\n     The scope and purpose of the Museum must be expanded, from its present\\none-sided emphasis on foreign Jewish sufferings, real and imagined, in\\nEurope during the 1930s and 1940s to a compassionate yet realistic concern\\nfor *all* victims, but above all for *American* victims, of historic\\ninjustice.\\n\\n     The Museum must be made a place where Americans of every heritage, and\\nscholars of every viewpoint, may gather, educate, and be educated, without\\naccusation and in the absence of propaganda.  Until it is, the men and\\nwomen who founded and built and suffered and fought and died for America,\\nof every race, nationality and creed, will rest uneasy.\\n\\n\\nNOTES\\n\\n     1. _The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Newsletter_\\n(Washington, D.C.), August, 1990, \"Survivors Play Major Role in\\nEstablishing the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum,\" p.1.

According to  sources close\\n       to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian\\n       militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos\\n       mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated\\n       that Abu  Nidal\\'s special  advisers are  giving military\\n       training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.\\n       They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for\\n       Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing\\n       their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the\\n       clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist\\n       groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations\\n       moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they\\n       would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a\\n       number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos\\n       mountains.\\n\\n       Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,\\n       which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in\\n       Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs\\n       of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material\\n       support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader\\n       of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,\\n       George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men\\n       not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out\\n       by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as \"extreme\\n       racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.\"  Reliable\\n       sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent\\n       operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that\\n       organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in\\n       extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he\\n       instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the\\n       PKK  and avoid clashing with it.

Another is to say that \"Only those\\nwho meet the religious definition of a Jew is one.\"  And there are\\nothers.  I\\'m not twisting your words.

I do believe that most people in a country\\ndo not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.\\nSuppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place \\nwhich now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as\\nwell as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.\\nNow suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the\\nfighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among \\npeople he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same\\ngod. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. \\nAnd, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created\\nwhere my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.\\nAnd, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And\\nthat people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and\\ngranted full-citizenship.\\nShould I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as\\n20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and\\nask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000\\nyears?\\n\\nThen, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.\\nI am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in \\nZionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.\\nHow would those who are Zionist define a Jew? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>\\n>>     Eric S.

Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \\nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\\n\\n\\t\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\\n\\tgoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\\n\\tpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\\n\\tloyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\\n\\ttenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\"\\n\\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\\n\\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\\n\\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\\noccupying forces.\\n\\nDuring the Independence War, the \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" held their\\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \\nbackbone of today\\'s modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \\nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\\n\\n\"Major Principles of the Constitution\"\\n\\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\\nwithin the following principles:\\n\\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \\n  law;\\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\\n  Turkish nation;\\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\\n  sex, or political beliefs;\\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\\n\\n\"Structure of the State\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\\nprinciple of \"division of power\" to create a balanced and self-controlled\\nsystem. The power is divided into \"legislative power,\" \"executive power,\" and\\n\"judicial power,\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\\nother (self-control).\\n\\n A. Legislative Power:\\n\\n The \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" is a parliament with one House, elected\\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\\n\\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\\n - to ratify international agreements;\\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\\n\\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\\n of twenty-one can vote.\\n\\n Elections are supervised by the \"Supreme Council of Elections,\" which solves\\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \"Board of Election\"\\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \\n independent judges.\\n\\n B. Executive Power:\\n\\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\\n\\n - to represent the State and the Country;\\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\\n \\n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \\n call for a referendum.\\n\\n Executive power is exercised by the \"Council of Ministers,\" headed by the\\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\\n Ministers in the Council.\\n\\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\\n \"administrative\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\\n functions against any law.\\n\\n C. Judicial Power:\\n\\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be \\n discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the\\n reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories\\n of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:\\n\\n - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The \\n   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice\\n   upon the appeal of the parties involved.\\n - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\\n   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\\n   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\\n   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the\\n   high administrative court.\\n\\n The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the\\n \"Constitutional Court\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found\\n contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew\\nmust learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The\\nland in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same\\nnew Jew who has \"learned\" to work it. Both aspects of the\\ntwo-pronged concept of \"Hebrew labor\" have racist connotations. On\\nthe one hand, the diaspora Jew\\'s lack of training in physical\\nlabor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other\\nhand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the\\nArab farmer from the source of his livelihood.\\n\\nThe occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from\\nthe occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and\\nhot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \"Hebrew labor\" to the\\nhistory books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It\\nhas blossomed forth anew, however, as the government\\'s answer to\\nproblems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this\\nconcept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the\\nclosing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of\\nEnvironment Minister Yossi Sarid, \"I have no tears for those who\\nget rich off of cheap labor\". 2) to furnish an answer to the\\nunemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for\\nwages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.\\n\\nThe Israeli government is considering plans to import labor from\\nthe far- East to replace native people, Palestinians, who work in\\ntheir own country, thus creating conflicting interests between two\\nethnical communities and ruling over them.\\n\\n'),\n",

Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \\n I heard our Utica brass roar.\\n\\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\\n The came a shrill wailing.\\n\\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke.

Others pantomimed them in escape\\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women\\'s cries.\\n\\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \\n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\\n through alders, on smoldering houses.

Between \\n the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun \\n dress.\\n\\n The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He \\n lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the \\n pewter bowl he\\'d carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed \\n just below his neck, into the spine. \\n\\n There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around.

The Greeks started massacring \\nthe Turkish population on Cyprus in 1974. In 1974, Turkiye stepped into \\nCyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population there. This is \\nnothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, the intervention \\nwas too late at least for some of the victims. Mass graves containing \\nnumerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been \\nplanned for a peaceful minority.\\n\\nThe people of Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots \\nwill never abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain \\neternally hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the \\ncost to the parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was \\nthe sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops \\non July 15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of \\nArchibishop Makarios.\\n\\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\\n\\'enosis\\' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not\\nforget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks\\nin Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to\\ndestroy the island\\'s independence by annexing it to Greece. Of\\ncourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences \\nfor this irresponsible conduct.\\n\\nTurkish Cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a\\nrepeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the Greeks\\' EOKA. If \\nsuch assurances are not perfectly implemented, there is every reason \\nto expect that the local Greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate \\ntheir past mistakes. On such an occasion, the Turkish side may not find \\nit satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before, \\nfor it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical \\nvicious attacks. Therefore it would be better to have a true federation\\nof two separate sections living in obligatory peace, rather than another \\narmed confrontation that would be started by the Greeks and obligatorily \\nbut decisively terminated by the Turks. \\n\\nThe present Greek government is trying to tyrannize the Turkish population \\nin western Thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights, which \\nwere established through international treaties. One might be better\\nadvised to remember that misadventures against Turkiye do not serve \\nGreece well.\\n\\nAn offer of membership in the European Common Market as bait for concessions \\nthat may doom the Turks in Cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for \\nGreece or her friends.

I say, \"I don\\'t know, Igor, I haven\\'t turned on the TV.\" He looked \\nagain and said, \"Mamma, what\\'s going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so \\nmany people, it\\'s awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \\nyou can\\'t even tell how many there are. They\\'re shouting, \"Down with the \\nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is \\nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \\nunexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,\\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he\\'s \\naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \\ncan\\'t make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \\n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \\npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \\nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \\nAnd my son says, \"Those aren\\'t women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \\ndidn\\'t look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \\nsimply couldn\\'t sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \\nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what\\'s going on, what \\nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know what \\nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \\neach second or third one had a white rod. They\\'re waving the rods above their \\nheads as they walk, and the one who\\'s out front, like a leader, he has a white\\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \\ndon\\'t know.\\n\\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \\ndear, I\\'m frightened, they\\'re going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \\nyou afraid of, they\\'re just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \\nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \\nVocational School. \"Don\\'t fear,\" he said, \"it\\'s nothing, nothing all that \\nbad.\" He didn\\'t eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \\nWhen I heard that I couldn\\'t settle down at all, I kept walking here and \\nthere and I said, \"They\\'re going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \\nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \\nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they\\'re shouting\\ndifferent things, and you couldn\\'t hear every well. I say, \"You speak\\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they\\'re saying.\" He says \"Close the window\\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \\nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it\\'s\\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he\\'s sick, and all of this was\\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I\\'m going to go to bed in a minute\\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \\nThings had calmed down slightly.\\n\\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \\nget up.\" I say, \"Today\\'s my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren\\'t you going \\nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \\nyou going?\" He says, \"I\\'m going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \\noutside on a day like today? Don\\'t go out, for God\\'s sake. You never listen to\\nme, I know, and you\\'re not going to listen to me now, but at least don\\'t take \\nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \\nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn\\'t make it\\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\\n\\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o\\'clock in the after-\\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don\\'t be afraid, they\\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.\\'\\' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\\nit was four o\\'clock, five o\\'clock . . . and when he wasn\\'t home at seven I\\nsaid, \"Oh, they\\'ve killed Shagen!\"\\n\\nTires are burning in town, there\\'s black smoke in town, and I\\'m afraid, I\\'m \\nstanding on the balcony and I\\'m all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \\nthey\\'ve probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \\no\\'clock and he still hadn\\'t come home. And I\\'m afraid to go out. At ten\\no\\'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \\nI\\'m looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \\ndon\\'t want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn\\'t want me to see \\nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\\n\"look what they\\'re doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \\nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \\non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \\nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \\nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \\ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \\non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \\nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \\ninside, go inside! Instead why don\\'t you tell us if they are any of them in \\nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn\\'t say Armenians, \\nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They\\'ve killed\\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won\\'t be living for me without \\nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \\ngo to Khalida\\'s, and give me the key. When they come I\\'ll say that it\\'s my \\ndaughter\\'s apartment, that they\\'re off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \\nand went to the neighbor\\'s, but I couldn\\'t endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \\nhere, I\\'m going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa\\'s . . . Papa\\'s there.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \\nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \\nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they\\'re shouting, howling, \\nand I didn\\'t think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \\nUncle Shagen\\'s gone, let\\'s go see, maybe he\\'s dead in the garage or near the \\ngarage, let\\'s at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \\nEmma, where do you think you\\'re going?! Go back into the house, I\\'ll look for \\nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \\nI\\'m coming too.\" Well he wouldn\\'t let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \\nhere with us, I\\'m go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \\nEmma, there\\'s no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \\nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they\\'re already killed Alik, and Valery\\'s \\nthere . . . wheezing.\"\\n\\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don\\'t go near him, \\nor we\\'ll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he\\'s young--and came back and \\nsaid, \"I\\'m going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \\nAlik, maybe he\\'ll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \\nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \\ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\\n\\nI went upstairs to the neighbor\\'s. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \\nthere, their headlights are on, but they\\'re not touching them, they are still \\nlying where they were, they\\'re still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\\nwindow until four o\\'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn\\'t\\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\\no\\'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don\\'t\\ngo out, don\\'t go anywhere, I\\'m going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\\nalive . . . let me go . . . I\\'ve got the keys from work.\"\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \\ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \\nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \\nwanted to go in, but he wouldn\\'t let me. There were only four people in there,\\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn\\'t let me in. They\\nsaid, \"Shagen\\'s not here, he\\'s alive somewhere, he\\'ll come back.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s already seven o\\'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they\\'ve\\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it\\'s a younger person.\" Now Shagen \\njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \\nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they\\'ve \\nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \\ndead . . . he\\'s alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \\nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \\nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it\\'s not he, it\\'s somebody else entirely.\" \\nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I\\'ll find out all the same anyway, \\nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \\ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \\ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn\\'t Shagen. A few minutes \\nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \\nlike that there was no hope left.\\n\\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \\npeople.\\n\\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa\\'s been killed.\"\\n\\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \\nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \\nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \\nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \\nyes, that\\'s our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor\\'s office\\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen\\'s been taken to Baku.\\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We\\'re taking care of all that,\\ndon\\'t you worry, we\\'ll do everything, we\\'ll tell you about it. Where did you\\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\\nsays, \"You can\\'t stay home, we\\'re getting an ambulance right now, wait just\\none second, the head doctor is coming, we\\'re arranging an ambulance right\\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\\nlike a patient, and you\\'ll stay here and we\\'ll se~ later what to do next ...\"\\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor\\'s name is Izyat Jamalogli\\nSadukhov.\\n\\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \\npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \\nhospital until the 4th.\\n\\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let\\'s go.\" And the women, our \\ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \\nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They\\'re going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we\\'re going to make a positive\\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\\nstill can\\'t remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let\\'s \\ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it\\'s not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can\\'t look, no.\"\\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I\\'ll recognize them.\" He says, \\n\"Isn\\'t they\\'re anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \\nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\\nbeen injured at work . . .\\n\\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \\nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \\nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don\\'t know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \\ndown, I don\\'t remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \\nwe\\'ve identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\\n\\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it\\'s time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \\nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he\\'s sick? I should inform \\nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can\\'t do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \\nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \\nget here from Yerevan? There\\'s no transportation, it s impossible.\"\\n\\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \\nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \\nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I\\'m \\nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \\nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \\narson? Don\\'t they know what\\'s going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don\\'t have anyone \\nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\\nsays, \"Let\\'s bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \\nif it calms down, I\\'ll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\\n\\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \\nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \\n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you\\'re \\ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \\n\"Yes.\" \"And now you\\'re telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \\nforgot!\" Like that.\\n\\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \\nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \\ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it\\'s unclear\\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \\njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What\\'s your nationality?\" He \\nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he\\'s an\\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don\\'t know, they did something there, too \\n. . . it\\'s too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \\nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \\nthat\\'s where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \\nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \\n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\\n\\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \\nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\\nwere taken. He says he didn\\'t take them\\n\\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\\nit, that hasn\\'t been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \\nhave the trial when you don\\'t know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\\nI didn\\'t get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven\\'t straightened \\neverything out, I think that\\'s unjust.\"\\n\\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \\nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\\npercent of his body . . .\\n\\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \\ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \\nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \\ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \\nArmy. And now they\\'re fatherless...\\n\\nI couldn\\'t sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\\nyears\\' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn\\'t\\nknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are \\nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years\\' \\ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\\ncreep, with my bare hands I\\'ll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn\\'t a \\nSoviet trial, this is unjust!\" That\\'s what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\\n\\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \\nthey were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the \\ntrial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, \\'Glory to Turkey\\'?\" I \\nstill don\\'t understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \\nUnion. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still\\ndon\\'t understand why \"Glory to Turkey!\" I asked that question twice and got no\\nanswer . . . No one answered me . . .\\n\\n   May 19, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

AIRPORT\\n\\n    ESPIONAGE: Former police officer is taken into custody upon\\n    arriving from Philippines, where he had fled after FBI\\n    interrogation.\\n\\nBy Jenifer Warren, Times staff writer\\n\\nSan Francisco -- A former San Francisco police officer who fled to the\\nPhilippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law\\nenforcement information to an investigator for the Anti-Defamation\\nLeague was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges, police\\nsaid Friday.\\n\\nThomas J. Gerard who abruptly left the United States in October after\\nthe FBI questioned him about his activities, was apprehended Thursday\\nnight after a source in the Philippines told investigators that Gerard\\nwas returning home.\\n\\nGerard, 50, was booked into San Francisco County Jail early Friday\\nmorning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count\\neach of computer theft, burglary and conspiracy.\\n\\nIf convicted on all charges, Gerard could face 16 years in prison and\\n$40,000 in fines.  Bail was initially set at $250,000 after police\\nargued that he was a flight risk, but it was later reduced to $20,000. \\nA friend of Gerard was trying to post bail late Friday afternoon, a\\nsheriff\\'s spokeswoman said.\\n\\nGerard returned to the United because he missed his wife and child,\\nwith whom he lived on a houseboat in Sausalito, and \"wanted to have\\nhis day in court,\" said Police Capt. John Willett, his former boss and\\none of two arresting officers.\\n\\nGerard, an undercover agent for the Central Intelligence Agency from\\n1982 to 1985, also feared that the CIA was out to kill him, Willett\\nsaid.  In an interview with The Times last month, Gerard threatened to\\ndisclose illegal CIA support of death squads in Central America if he\\nwas indicted and tried on the San Francisco spying charges.\\n\\nGerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network\\noperated by the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil\\nrights organization.  Investigators allege that Gerard illegally gave\\ncriminal histories to Roy Bullock, a San Francisco art dealer who said\\nhe has been an undercover ADL intelligence operative for 40 years.\\n\\nInvestigators said they found confidential police files in Bullock\\'s\\nhome computer -- which contained entries on 10,000 people and 950\\ngroups -- and in boxes in his apartment.  Files have also been seized\\nunder search warrants from ADL offices in San Francisco and Los\\nAngeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.\\n\\nGerard could not be reached for comment Friday, and his attorney,\\nJames Lassart, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.  In the\\ninterview with The Times last month, however, Gerard acknowledged\\nsnooping and sharing some information with Bullock, but denied any\\ncriminal wrongdoing.\\n\\nBullock and Gerard also are under investigation for selling\\nintelligence to South Africa.\\n\\nADL officials have described Bullock as a $550-a-week independent\\ncontractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal\\nactivity.  On Friday, ADL lawyer Jerrold Ladar said Gerard\\'s arrest\\n\"has nothing to do with ADL.  Other than that, we have no comment on\\nthe case.\"\\n\\nArab-American groups -- which were a main target of the spying,\\naccording to police -- applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to\\npursue the investigation.\\n\\n\"We urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly\\ndisclose the full extent of ADL and law enforcement involvement,\" said\\nJames Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute in Washington.\\n\\nPolice, meanwhile, characterized Gerard\\'s arrest -- the first in the\\ninquiry into the spying scandal -- as an unexpected breakthrough.  A\\nformer police colleague of Gerard, Inspector Fred Mollat, visited\\nGerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home.\\n\\n\"I knew he wouldn\\'t want to live on an island on the lam forever, but\\nwe didn\\'t think it would happen this quickly,\" Capt. Willett said. \\n\"This development really speeds up our timetable on the case.\"\\n\\nDuring his 25-year career on the police force, Gerard was a highly\\nregarded officer known for his work in the department\\'s intelligence\\ndivision.  His last assignment was on the gang task force.\\n\\nAfter FBI agents questioned Gerard last fall, he took early retirement\\nand fled to the remote jungle island of Palawan, 300 miles south of\\nManila.\\n\\nGerard was arrested at 8:40 p.m. as he stepped from his Philippines\\nAirlines flight. He was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard\\nafter his six-month hiatus, police said.\\n\\n\"He was surprised when he saw us standing there, and got a shocked\\nlook on his face,\" Willett said.  \"Then he said, \\'Hello, I\\'m back.\\'\"\\n \\n--\\nYigal Arens\\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\\narens@isi.edu\\n'),\n",

But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority\\nover the whole \\nisland, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation. \\n    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the\\nUAE has since the \\nAbu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part\\nof a general \\nsettlement. \\n    The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against\\nIraq for not fully \\nimplementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of\\nKuwait. \\n    They endorsed once again the \"Damascus Declaration,\" a pact signed\\nwith Egypt and \\nSyria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove\\nIraqi troops out of \\nKuwait. \\n    But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a\\nfund they \\nannounced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year\\nwhich would have \\nhelped Egypt\\'s and Syria\\'s economic development programme. \\n    They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of\\ncontributions from each state \\nalthough the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the\\n$10 billion agreed \\nlast year. \\n    The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia,\\nBahrain, Kuwait, Oman and \\nQatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although\\ntheir unity was only \\nmaintained with outside help. \\n    Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow\\nprogress of the \\nconservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the\\nregion that boasts \\nthe bulk of global oil and gas reserves. \\n    The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. \\n    One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman\\'s Sultan Qaboos\\nto create a \\n100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member\\nagainst external \\naggression, such as Iraq\\'s invasion of Kuwait. \\n    Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man\\n\"Peninsula \\nShield\" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is\\ncommanded by a Saudi \\ngeneral. \\n    Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market\\nalthough the summit \\ncalled for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year\\'s summit due\\nto be held in \\nSaudi Arabia next December. \\n REUTER YA DYA DJG \\n\\n\\n\\nRTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT \\n\\n    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter -

But that doesn\\'t mean everything that comes out of\\nhis mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience\\nshows), Pa\\'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his\\nanti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be\\nconsidered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of\\ncourse you don\\'t consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy\\n\"quotation\" that you can use to attack Israel.\\n\\nBenny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a \"scholar\"\\nwhen he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don\\'t be fooled.\\nIt\\'s just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an\\nattack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at\\nthe section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,\\nyou will see his \"indictment\" to be pure hot air.  And this is the\\nBEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning\\nevidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as\\n\"scholarly,\" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see\\nthat his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.\\n\\nThe Deir Yassin \"massacre\" never took place as the propagandists\\ntell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila \"massacres.\" Do you get\\nthe feeling people like to blame the Jews for \"massacres,\" even if\\nthey have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews\\nlike to do it, for reasons of their own.\\n\\nPlease, don\\'t confuse any of you Deir Yassin \"massacre\" stuff\\nwith facts or scholarship.

Already three times during the past weeks I\\nhave gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more\\nhorrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of\\nhouses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely\\ndemolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more\\nbrutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the\\nresidents were still told to remove their valuables from their\\nhomes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the\\nhandcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied\\nwith some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to\\nstand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were\\neven allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just\\ngold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday,\\nsome 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind\\ntheir backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants\\non their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their\\nhearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their\\nhomes, one after the other.\\n\\n(...)\\n\\nDr. Juma\\'a Fuad Said al-Rubi. the brother from Saudi Arabia,\\nemerges from among the ruins.

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\\nour lives into \"before\" and \\'\\'after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \\nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\\nlosses and everything that happened.\\n\\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \\nthose who didn\\'t.\\n\\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \\ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn\\'t think that the danger was\\nnear and possible, so we didn\\'t take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \\nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\\n\\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\\nlike it\\'s all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \\napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \\nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \\nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We\\'re known as a \\nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \\nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\\n\\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \\nmother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \\nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \\nexpected it of her, she\\'s afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \\ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \\n\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you\\'re not to come out \\nof the bedroom. We\\'re going to tell them that we\\'re alone in the apartment.\"\\n\\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \\ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \\nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \\nme. I\\'m an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \\nwas thinking the same thing, but she\\'s quite reserved. We didn\\'t have time to \\nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \\nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\\nexcited voices. I couldn\\'t figure what was going on out there because the door\\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \\nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \\nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \\neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn\\'t see. They \\ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \\nroom. He didn\\'t utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \\nsnatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \\nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\\n\\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \\nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don\\'t know Armenian, \\nthey don\\'t need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \\nyour children both . . . we\\'re going to do the same thing to you and your \\nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \\nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \\nso on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \\nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren\\'t any older people \\namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \\nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I\\'m \\na teacher.\\n\\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \\nhim in there, no they didn\\'t take him in there, they dragged him in there,\\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \\nbut a crack. We couldn\\'t see what was happening to Father, what they were \\ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \\nMamma\\'s sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I\\'m old enough to \\nbe your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he\\'s being held, \\nMamma identified him. I hope he\\'s convicted. Then they went after Karina, \\nwho\\'s been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \\nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \\nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \\nmustn\\'t do it. She said, \"Come on, let\\'s straighten this out, without \\nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \\never do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \\ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \\ncoming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \\ncame here to kill them.\"\\n\\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \\ndidn\\'t cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \\nshe said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\\n\\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \\nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \\nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \\nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \\nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\\ndid to her. That\\'s why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \\nthey beat her savagely . . . It\\'s really amazing that she not only lived, but \\ndidn\\'t lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \\ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \\nkicking her, using anything they could find.\\n\\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn\\'t feel any pain, \\njust didn\\'t feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \\ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn\\'t enough room in the\\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \\ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let\\'s take her \\noutside.\"\\n\\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \\nweren\\'t afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \\nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren\\'t \\nafraid of what would happen to them.\\n\\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \\nwith blood--that\\'s when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \\ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \\nI were recording it all on film. I think I\\'m a kind person by nature, but I\\'m \\nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don\\'t deserve it. I hold \\na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \\nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I\\'d remember them, \\nand I\\'ll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \\n\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\\n\\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \\ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \\nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\\nhe\\'s being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \\nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \\nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \\nI felt myself flying. I couldn\\'t figure out if I was really flying or if I \\njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I\\'m going to smash on the \\nground. And when it didn\\'t happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \\nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn\\'t scream, didn\\'t beg them at all,\\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\\n\\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \\nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn\\'t \\nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \\neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn\\'t worth \\nliving.\\n\\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \\npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \\nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \\nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \\nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \\nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \\nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \\none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \\neven during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \\nalthough, of course, he knew that I\\'d never forgive him. Something like that \\nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \\nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person\\'s shoes,\\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \\nforget it.\\n\\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \\ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \\nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn\\'t be able to do anything.\\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\\n\\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn\\'t, so he tried to \\nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \\nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \\nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don\\'t know which one it \\nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \\nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \\nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \\nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \\nfrom the Melkumians\\' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \\nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He\\'s a good person. He said, \\n\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\\nsays, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \\nthink I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \\neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \\nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \\nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \\nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \\nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \\ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\\n\\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \\nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn\\'t even \\nremember my sister\\'s name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn\\'t\\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\\nthere by chance, that they weren\\'t Armenians. Lyuda\\'s a Russian, you can tell \\nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I\\'m glad \\nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \\nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\\n\\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \\nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \\nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\\nhelp!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \\ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \\nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \\nneighbors.\\n\\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \\nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\\n \\nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \\nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \\nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \\nsure that I was dead because I didn\\'t react at all to the new blows. Someone \\nsaid, \"She\\'s already dead, let\\'s throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \\nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don\\'t kill her, I know her, she\\'s a \\nteacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can\\'t remember\\nwhose voice it was. It wasn\\'t Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \\naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \\tI having opened my \\neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \\nbeen beaten so much that I didn\\'t have the strength to remember him. I only \\nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \\nI can\\'t remember anything more.\\n\\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn\\'t treat me badly. I had heard a lot \\nabout him, that he wasn\\'t that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \\nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\\nif he was wounded, then it\\'s about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \\nUfa, and was injured, but that\\'s not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \\nall out later.\\n\\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \\nof the Party organization. I don\\'t know his last name, his first name is \\nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn\\'t so sure,\\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \\ndidn\\'t want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \\nlater, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \\nNo, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \\nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \\nentirely different. The investigators haven\\'t summoned him yet. He came to see\\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \\ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \\ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don\\'t know if he was putting \\nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \\nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn\\'t in Sumgait. \\nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \\nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don\\'t know how the \\ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn\\'t he have gone \\nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I\\'m not ruling out that possibility.\\n\\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \\nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \\nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband\\'s \\nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \\nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He\\'s an orphan who was raised by\\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \\nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I\\'ll say this--I\\'m \\na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He\\'s healthy, he can think just fine, \\nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he\\'s cunning, too. \\nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\\n\\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \\nand money in your apartment we\\'ll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \\nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \\neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \\nover and taking the gold from one another. I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t kill one \\nanother right then.\\n\\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \\nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn\\'t walk; like me, he was half dead, \\nhalfway into the other world. He couldn\\'t comprehend anything, couldn\\'t see, \\nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \\nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\\n\\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \\nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \\nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \\neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \\nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \\nthreshold I couldn\\'t hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \\ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors\\'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \\ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \\nout of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \\nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\\n\\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \\nwas already outside, I didn\\'t know what they were doing to her. I was left all\\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \\nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \\nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \\nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \\nthat all of that would die with me.\\n\\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \\ndidn\\'t know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\\nyou?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\\nI would remember him. That\\'s when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \\ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \\ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \\nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \\nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor\\'s axe froze in \\nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \\npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \\nor not. He said, \"Enough, let\\'s go to the third entryway.\" In the third \\nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \\nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \\nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \\nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \\nalready taken the other.\\n\\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn\\'t obey their general. They\\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \\nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \\nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\\n\"Sister, don\\'t be afraid, I\\'ll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\\nThat\\'s just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \\nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I\\'ll drive\\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\\nand nail the door shut, because they\\'ll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \\nThat\\'s when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \\nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \\nto, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\\n\\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn\\'t do it by myself. \\nMarina\\'s old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \\nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \\nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\\n\\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \\nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \\nanything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won\\'t leave you here. Would any of the \\nneighbors let you in? They\\'ll be back, they won\\'t calm down, they know you\\'re \\nalive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\\n\\nThen he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \\nThey said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \\nyourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \\ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What\\'s the mat-\\nter, aren\\'t you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \\nhe couldn\\'t hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \\ntold him at the neighbors\\' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\\ngood terms with them.\\n\\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \\nopened the door and immediately said, \"I\\'m an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \\nLet her sit at your place a while. Don\\'t open the door to anyone, no one knows\\nabout this, I won\\'t tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\\nhave her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \\nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \\ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina\\'s old fur coat, it\\'s a short one, a \\nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \\nis, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don\\'t know anything. I\\'m afraid \\nto go out of the apartment, now they\\'re so wild that they don\\'t look to see \\nwho\\'s Azerbaijani and who\\'s Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \\nneighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don\\'t want to lose my life because of you, \\nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \\nstill there. When I\\'m nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \\ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\\n\\nI went out and didn\\'t know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \\ndon\\'t know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \\nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \\napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \\nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \\nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \\nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \\nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \\nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \\nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \\ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that\\'s what saved me. They were \\nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father\\'s sport \\njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \\nAnd again I realized I wasn\\'t getting out of there alive, and I started to \\nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \\nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \\nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone\\'s hand was\\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn\\'t know \\nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \\nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \\nhad never been so close to death and couldn\\'t imagine how you could go on \\nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \\nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda\\'s place or someone is hiding her. \\nI tried to think that Igor wouldn\\'t let them be killed. He served in \\nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\\n\\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \\nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \\nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\\nchildren\\'s footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \\nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \\njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \\nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \\nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that\\'s just what I need. \\nAll these years I\\'ve been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \\n\"Neither of you gets it. We\\'ll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \\nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn\\'t set fire to the apartment, and\\nleft.\\n\\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \\nfrequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \\nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \\nsaid, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \\nvery often.\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

And your criminal organization will not get away \\nwith the genocide\\'s cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in \\nSebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem \\ndistricts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed\\nand hundreds of civilians also perished.\\n\\n   Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included \\n   the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,\\n   Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives, \\n   children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians \\n   joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan \\n   districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of\\n   3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished\\n   to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to\\n   the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and\\n   seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell\\n   into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims\\n   themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels\\n   also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the\\n   large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from\\n   occupying the city.\\n\\n   The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out\\n   the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the\\n   neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha\\'s nephew alive. They\\n   raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours\\'\\n   distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.\\n\\n   At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,\\n   Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible\\n   atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in\\n   the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the\\n   neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.\\n\\n   Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the\\n   Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four\\n   villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,\\n   they continued to spread death and destruction among the\\n   Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down\\n   their arms. \\n\\nSource: Uras, Esat: The Armenians in History.

Basic ANTI-TRUST law says\\nthat, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of\\ninvesting, you can not acquire a large number of those\\nshares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so\\nonly if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,\\nthe Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some\\ndesigns, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.\\nThey were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.\\n\\nThe palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the\\nold tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /\\nmulti-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours\\nwas no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair\\nmarket value, etc...

I beleive that Israel is democratic\\nwithin the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).\\nIsrael probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic\\ncleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the\\ninternational community, or make the best out of a no win\\ncondition: show the world how good Israel is towards the\\n\\'bad\\' arabs.

In December, Israel\\ndeported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to\\nHamas\\'s kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer\\nversion appears in the May issue of Harper\\'s Magazine, which\\nobtained and translated the tape.)\\n \\n     My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a\\nrefugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished\\nhigh school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work\\nfor Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I\\'m married and I have\\ntwo daughters.\\n     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine\\nexplicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is\\nPalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and\\nwomen have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]\\nSecurity Services.\\n     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,\\ncooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most\\nimportant objective must be to put an end to the plague of\\ncollaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and\\ninterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose\\nthe methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into\\ncollaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,\\nwe confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.\\n     We don\\'t execute every collaborator. After all, about 70\\npercent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into\\ntheir misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is\\nbased on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many\\ncollaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli\\nBorder Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.\\nHe\\'s as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an\\nIsraeli soldier.\\n     There\\'s another group of collaborators who perform an even\\nmore loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men\\nand women in blackmail schemes that force them to become\\ncollaborators. I regard the \"isqat\" [the process by which a\\nPalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as\\ngreater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is\\nguilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious\\nduty to execute him.\\n     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the\\ndistribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the\\nSecurity Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their\\nvictims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and\\nimpossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the\\ndrugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.\\n     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of\\nuncovering collaborators, We can\\'t afford to abduct an innocent\\nperson, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished\\nforever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after\\nevidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If\\nafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any\\ndoubt, then he is executed.\\n     In many cases, we don\\'t have to make our evidence against\\ncollaborators public, because everyone knows that they\\'re guilty.\\nBut when the public isn\\'t aware that a certain individual is a\\ncollaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for\\nevidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be\\nirrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually\\nobtained in the form of a confession.\\n     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start\\noff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell\\nhim that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the\\nlast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the\\ninformation we need.\\n     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has\\nbeen a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them\\nconfess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply\\npressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts\\nconfess as well.\\n     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an\\ninterrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working\\nfor the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself\\nconfessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the\\ninformation to us. In addition, three members of his network of\\ncollaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this\\nmuch evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are\\nvery careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our\\nprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he\\nhimself confesses his crimes. \\n     A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of\\ncollaborators to decide whether there were any who could be\\nexecuted without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of\\nnames, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not\\nmark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for\\nexecution.\\n     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But\\nafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can\\'t shoot him\\n-- to do so might give away our locations. That\\'s why collaborators\\nare strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \"What do you\\nthink? How should we execute you?\" One collaborator told us,\\n\"Strangle me.\" He hated the sight of blood.\\n\\n-----\\nNaftaly Stramer \\t\\t\\t | Intergraph Electronics\\nInternet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A    \\nVoice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301\\n\"Quality is everybody\\'s job, and it\\'s everybody\\'s job to watch all that they can.\"\\n'),\n",

But\\nthe chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn\\'t\\nbe submitted for discussion.\\n   Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon\\na special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for\\nthe Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn\\'t consider that the deputates have the \\nobjective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the\\nserious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the\\nrepublic\\'s authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,\\nejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion\\non these questions.\\n   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,\\nwhen it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.\\n   The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50\\ndeputates (25 \"democrats\" and 25 \"partocrates\"). At that time \"democrats\" and\\n\"partocrates\" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn\\'t exist for a long \\ntime and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time,\\nthe deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon\\na session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out\\nof the Parliament. --0--\\n\\n\\nTHE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA\\n\\n    Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement\\nbetween Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign \\nMinister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics,\\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18. \\nThe group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman, the chief of the Ministry of\\nEconomics of Estonia.\\n   The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency, that in their stay in Baku,\\nthe delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the\\nrepublic.--0--\\n\\n\\nAZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE\\n\\n   Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic, Vahid\\nAhmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn\\'t join the CIS\\ncommon economic zone.\\n   Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a \\ncommon tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. \\nAccording to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for\\nthe discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a number\\nof unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.\\n   Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the\\nbackground of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of\\nthe Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic\\nzone.--0--\\n\\n\\nTHE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW\\n\\n     Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director\\nof the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic\\nalong with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to\\nhold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan. \\nAccording to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles.\\n    As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan\\'s correspondent, \\nprecise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other\\nquestions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in\\nMoscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling\\nof industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia.\\n    When the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end \\nof May.--0--\\n\\n\\nAZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF\\nMAY\\n\\n     Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia,\\nTurkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia, the representative of the\\npresident of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, Asim Gasimov noted\\nthat the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.\\n     \"Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by \\ninsistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis\\nof the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6\",- said\\nGasimov.\\n     The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just\\nbegan to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be \\ngiven as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26.\\n     As it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by\\nArmenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0--\\n\\n\\nTHE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN\\n\\n   BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor\\'s office has announced\\nthat the Russian mass media\\'s attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers \\ncondemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court, as innocent\\npeople is unjustified.\\n    Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves,\\nprove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units\\nand with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where they\\nserved.\\n    The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers\\nas ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also \\nunfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the\\nlist of one of the military unit\\'s of Russian commandos in Yerevan.\\n   Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of\\nthe Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the\\nRussian community. Azerbaijan\\'s prosecutor\\'s announcement follows, that this\\ntype of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--\\n\\n\\nAZERBAIJAN\\'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE\\nSIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan\\nis considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six\\naccused soldiers\\' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives\\nof the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation\\nto Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers\\' case will\\nbe directed to Russian parliament.\\n     According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give\\nRussian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the\\ninvestigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have\\ngiven rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation\\nin the war against Azerbaijan.\\n\\n\\nARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE \"KARABAKHS\" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of \\nArmenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies\\non the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the\\nnewspaper \"Russky vestnik\" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.\\n     The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the \\ndocuments of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of \"reunion\" of\\nthe North Caucasus and \"Armenia proper\" at present, the front is appealing to \\nthe UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the\\nneed to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.\\n     To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to\\ncarry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity \"identical to\\nthose in Nagorno Karabakh\". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian\\nnational-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of\\nArmenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus \\ninstructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.\\n     Thus according to the newspaper \"Russky vestnik\", \"new Karabakhs\" are \\nbeing planning on the North Caucasus. --O--\\n\\n\\nSTATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of\\nAzerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural\\ncenters was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president\\nElchibey\\'s decree on state assistance for the development of language and\\nculture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered. \\n     The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a\\nlegal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership\\nof Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all \\nnationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.\\n     The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy,\\nHidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the \"undeclared\\nwar\" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many \\nproblems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic\\ngroups. \\n     For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of\\nJustice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture \\nand means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign\\ndiplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of\\nfree accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary). \\n     As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted\\nto create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of\\nAzerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened, \\nradiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the\\neducational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national\\nteaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences\\nof Azerbaijan.--O-- \\n\\n\\nMEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State \\nconcern \"Azerineft\", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies\\n\"AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum\", \"Bi-Pi Exploration Operating\", \"Pennzoil\\nCaspian\", \"Unocal Khazar Ltd.\", \"McDermott\" and Turkish oil corporation on\\nmutual extracting of fields \"Azeri\", \"Chirag\" and \"Gyuneshli\" was signed. \\nAccording to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common\\nprogram of activity was created. \\n     According to the president of \"Azerineft\", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation\\nwill provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. \\n     During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of\\noil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of\\nexploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the\\nexploitation of these fields. \\nThe memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical\\nand political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas\\nfields. --O--\\n\\n\\nARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on \\nsix Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh,\\nArmenian propaganda has become actively involved.\\n     The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin\\nwith a request \"to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian\\nsoldiers\". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings\\non the case in Baku as \"a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia\".\\n     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could\\nbelieve the Yerevan agency \"Snark\", the Armenians in Karabakh presented\\nan ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum\\nis that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in\\nKarabakh will be shot dead.\\n     It is simple to explain such \"touching attitude of Armenians\" to\\nthe six Russian soldiers\\' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed\\nit will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused\\nRussian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister\\nof Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.\\n     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its\\nsaving of lives of \"innocent Russians\". --O--\\n\\n\\nNEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of\\nAzerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan\\nfrom the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.\\n     The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz,\\nNyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from\\nKafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were\\ndestructions in the villages.\\n     On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere,\\nShynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of\\nAzerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in\\nprogress.\\n     At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of\\nArmenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated\\ninto the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two\\nshepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a\\nflock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O--\\n\\n\\n\"UNOCAL\" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the\\nrepresentation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this\\ncompany decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of\\n50 houses for refugees.\\n     At present, the American side suggested a village project for \\nconsideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project\\nis a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary\\naccommodations and so on.\\n     According to the program the construction and putting into\\noperation of the village will be this year. --O--\\n\\n\\nMANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the\\nnational currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian\\nRuble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.\\nTaking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with \\nrespect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value\\n10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is\\nthe same at banks, state establishments and in trade.\\n     According to the representatives of the business circles and\\nexperts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles\\nare bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial\\noperations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics\\nof the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen\\narrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business \\nwith Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much \\nRubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--\\n\\n\\nTHE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY\\n\\n    Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president\\'s decree, the\\nexpert group, including representatives of the Parliament and \\npresidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitution\\nof the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before\\nthe Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the new\\nConstitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament of\\nthe country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on the\\npress-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before.\\n    Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and \\nrepresentatives of the department of the president\\'s apparatus Fazil Mustafaev\\nand Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference.\\n    The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary\\nelection law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the bill\\ndidn\\'t cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternative\\nvariant of the election law was put forward.\\n   The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissions\\nwill examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 all\\nproposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0--\\n\\n\\nISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR \\nCLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED\\n\\n   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the\\nAzerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairman\\nof the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with\\nthe conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeant\\nK. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the\\nSupreme Court of Azerbaijan.\\n   In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan\\nMilly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme\\nSoviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal\\ncase. In his view, \"the conclusion of the commission could help in the \\nobjective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems\\nin the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote the\\nknowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime\".\\n   In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message,\\nMilly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which the\\npermanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human\\nrights and international relations are charged with the exploration of\\nthis problem.--0--\\n\\n\\nWILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?\\n\\n      Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative\\nto the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the \\nTrilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with\\nthe representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case\\nthe peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin\\'s initiative itself.\\n     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors\\nof the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is\\npaving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from\\nthe peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and\\nUS having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial\\nUS departure from Transcaucasia.--0--\\n\\n\\nFATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER\\n\\n   Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,\\nSabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of\\noil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.\\nAs it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-\\nRAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian\\nfields.\\n   According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete\\ntreaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO and\\nPENNZOIL will sign treaties.\\n   Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645\\nmillion ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.ton\\non Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.\\n   The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to\\nbring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the net\\neconomic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in\\nthe defence of its interests at the international scene.\\n   As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement \"the May of\\n1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its\\nindependence and we have to stand these tests\".--0--\\n\\nTHE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN\\n\\n   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan\\ninforms, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the\\nRussian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received.\\nThe appeal contains the call \"to display mercy, humanism and clemency \\non the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed\\nForces\".\\n   The authors of the appeal point out, that they don\\'t justify the\\nparticipation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people,\\ndon\\'t call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce\\nthe mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about the\\nRussian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.\\n    At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers\\'\\nmothers\\' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the\\npresident of Azerbaijan to \"save those guys\".\\n   It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers\\' mothers,\\ntaking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only\\nRussian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay down\\nlives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made\\nanswerable.\\n    Unfortunately, the appeal didn\\'t mention the grief of the mothers\\nof Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0--\\n\\n\\nARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS\\n\\n     BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army of\\nAzerbaijan were killed during the \"Grad\" shelling of the villages of\\nKolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of\\nthe republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia.\\n     The night before and in the morning of May 22, the villages of\\nTovuz, Gazakh and Gubatly districts of Azerbaijan were under fire\\nfrom the territory of Armenia.

The business cooperation between the two countries\\ndevelops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil\\nextraction equipment, communication and agriculture.\\n  According to the Minister\\'s words, the forthcoming visit of\\nAzerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May\\n23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit will\\nhelp, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch\\noffices of some British banks, insurance firms; to conclude\\ncontracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on\\nbuilding in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the\\nentire communication system of Azerbaijan.\\n   In Garayev\\'s view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain\\nwill have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.\\n   According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, Great\\nBritain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation of\\nthe economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O--\\n\\n           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\n             T U R A N    N E W S    A G E N C Y\\n                     Baku - Azerbaijan      \\n                Phone: (8922) 66-7977  66-7833\\n                    Fax: (8922) 66-2009\\n                   Telex: 142168 META SU\\n           \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n                  \\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

P. A1.\\n\\nNEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE\\n\\n\\t* INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage\\n\\t  by a man who infiltrated political groups\\n\\nBy Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time\\nart dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In\\nreality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and\\namassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40\\nyears.\\n\\nHis code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was\\nso successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen\\nto head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi\\n(D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.\\n\\nFor a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White\\nAryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he\\nobtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. \\nAnd he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government\\nto trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.\\n\\nThese are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former\\nLos Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with\\npolice and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide\\nintelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.\\n\\nOfficials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper\\nactivity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They\\nhave refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.\\n\\nTranscripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents\\nreleased by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details\\nof the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line\\ninto illegal territory.\\n\\nAt times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air\\nwith laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with\\nforeign agents and code names like \"Ironsides\" and \"Flipper.\"\\n\\nOn one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a\\npro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa,\\nIsrael.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties\\nto Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him. \\nShortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed\\nhim.\\n\\nThe court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA\\nagent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing\\nconfidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.\\n\\nGerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by\\nthe FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its\\ncontents included passports, driver\\'s licenses and identification\\ncards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for\\nfour American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank\\nbirth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from\\nvarious agencies.\\n\\nAlso in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a\\nblack hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of\\nblindfolded and chained men.\\n\\nInvestigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the\\nADL confidential driver\\'s license or vehicle registration information\\non a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one\\ntarget group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.\\n\\nEach case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would\\nconstitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in\\nan affidavit for a search warrant.\\n\\nThe Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil\\nrights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on\\ngroups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL\\'s\\nfact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a\\nreputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with\\npolice agencies and journalists. \\n\\nHowever, evidence seized from Bullock\\'s computer shows he kept files\\non at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the\\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United\\nFarm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for\\nInvestigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the\\nAsian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.\\n\\nThe computer files also included information on several members of\\nCongress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman\\nRon Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey\\nfrom the Bay Area.\\n\\nIn their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation\\nLeague has collected information on political activists in the Los\\nAngeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely\\nwith three Los Angeles County sheriff\\'s deputies who specialized in\\nintelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism\\nexpert and a San Diego County Sheriff\\'s Department intelligence\\nofficer.\\n\\nA spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff\\'s Department said he knew\\nnothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los\\nAngeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the\\ninvestigation, and the San Diego Sheriff\\'s Department declined\\ncomment.\\n\\nBullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy\\ndrama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a\\nvolunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a\\nbook about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.\\n\\nBullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by\\nthe ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the\\nmid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations\\nup and down the West Coast.\\n\\nTo keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled\\nthrough Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never\\nmissed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.\\n\\n\"I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all\\nanti-democratic movements,\" Bullock said.  \". . . Officially, I\\'m only\\na contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not\\nbe officially connected with me.\"\\n\\nBullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists\\nto Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own\\nname but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.\\n\\n\"I\\'m one of a kind,\" he told police.\\n\\nIn recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become\\nknown, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a\\nshotgun who threatened to kill him.\\n\\nIn the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a\\nsynagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and\\nmatching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by\\npolice.  In part because of this investigation, he became close\\nfriends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco\\npolice intelligence division.\\n\\nBullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An\\nFBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:\\n\\n\"Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and\\nwould share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to\\nGerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to\\nBullock.\"\\n\\nFrom a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876\\nindividuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files\\ncontained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.\\n\\nIn 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of\\ninformation to the South African government.  Bullock tells of\\nmeetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels\\nand receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100\\nbills.\\n\\nBullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled\\nonly from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published\\nby San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African\\nBishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli --\\nand submitted it as his own work.\\n\\nBullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence. \\nBullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government\\nevenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, \"I may be gay but I\\'m a\\nstraight arrow.\"\\n\\nIn his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about\\nengaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to\\nviolate the law.\\n\\nFor example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver\\'s license records\\nand criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of\\nthe confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said\\nGerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence\\nfiles on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under\\ndepartment policy.\\n\\nBullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation\\nof Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League\\'s San\\nFrancisco office.\\n\\nBullock seemed proud of his \"Operation Eavesdrop,\" in which he used a\\npaid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan\\nResistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by\\nmembers of the right-wing group.  \"For a short time, it was\\nwonderful,\" he told police.\\n\\nIn Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago\\nas a \"fact-finder\" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go\\nundercover to the meetings of target groups.\\n\\nAmong other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles\\nADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had \"anti-Israel\\nleanings\" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such\\nsentiment.\\n\\nGurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he\\nattempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a\\nrival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for\\nHolocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival\\nand threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate\\ngroup.\\n\\nGurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the\\nprobe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation. \\nUnlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nGurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed\\nby The Times. Bullock\\'s attorney said his client would not comment.\\n--\\nYigal Arens\\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\\narens@isi.edu\\n'),\n",

The\\ntwo SHABAK interrogators who were responsible for his death were put\\non trial. In September \\'91 the Supreme Court rejected their appeal and\\nsentenced them to 6 months in prison.  As far as is known, this was\\nthe first time in Israel\\'s history that SHABAK operatives were sent to\\nprison.  The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the warning by the\\ndirector of SHABAK that the sentence will be detrimental the\\neffectiveness of other interrogators. [...] The judges in the case\\nwere [...] Barak, Goldberg, and Matza.\\n\\nWhen they realized that they were on their own, the interrogators\\nagreed to talk.  Deputy State Attorney Rachel Sukkar[sp?] was placed\\nin charge of investigating the affair.  She [...] questioned the\\ndirectors of all SHABAK divisions.  She investigated only the matter\\nof the death in Gaza prison.  She discovered that not only torture,\\nbut also \"the culture of lies\", which Judge Landau had described in\\nhis report of two years before, were still very much in existence. \\nNothing had changed.\\n\\nThe report was classified and was seen by only some ten people, among\\nthem the Prime Minister, the people at the top of the judicial system\\nand Judge Landau.  The director of SHABAK claimed that he did not\\nknow.  After all, they were dealing only with a single jail and with\\nlow ranking people.  The system bit the bullet and accepted the\\nexplanation.  One of SHABAK\\'s high-ranking officials was transfered\\nfrom his very high position to a less high position.\\n\\n. . .\\n\\n[\"The culture of lies\" referred to above is the SHABAK interrogators\\'\\npolicy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were\\ntortured in the course of interrogation.  The Landau commission sought\\nto correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods --\\nthus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those\\nmethods were used to extract a confession.  The fact that the need to\\nlie still persists would seem to indicate that SHABAK is not sticking\\nto the \"approved\" torture methods. -- Yigal]\\n--\\nYigal Arens\\nUSC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!\\narens@isi.edu\\n'),\n",

Friday local Tel Aviv\\'s\\npaper, affiliated with Maariv.\\n\\nDate: 19 February 1993\\n\\nJournalist: Guy Ehrlich\\n\\nSubject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan\\n(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate\\nwithin the occupied territories.\\n\\nExcerpts from the article:\\n\\n\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as\\nArabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most\\nimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is\\nthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one\\nway or another insane\".\\n\\nA man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name\\nis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge\\nfrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be\\ncalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to\\ndepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different\\nfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript\\nservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completely\\ndifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures\\nabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of their\\nfellows from the Cherry it woundn\\'t be easy either. Yet after they\\nbegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.\\nThe following article will contain all the horror stories\\nrecounted with an appalling openness.\\n\\n(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in\\nwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We\\ncalled such soldiers H.I. \\'Hit by the Intifada\\'. Under my command\\nwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common\\nphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I\\nshould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On\\nFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to\\nuntil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The\\nkeys of my father\\'s car must be ready for in advance, so that I\\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don\\'t\\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\\nthere I become normal.(...)\\n\\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled off\\nsomething.\\n\\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shut\\nup\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'All\\nright, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look at\\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn\\'t know\\nwhat to say.\\n\\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\\nhad hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\\nbeasts of prey. We couldn\\'t explain what had happened to us. We\\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\\nfelt the whole day very badly.\\n\\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\\nGodlike of sorts.\"\\n\\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. \\'Why\\nshouldn\\'t I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?\\nWhy shouldn\\'t I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver\\nwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits\\nme perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a\\nreasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to\\nBosnia in order to fight there.\"\\n\\nTransl. by Israel Shahak.\\n\\n'),\n",

The historical evidence proves that during \\nthe period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, \\nassisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people \\nbecause of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts \\nof sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, \\nset up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts \\nbehind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly \\nattacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population \\nindiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike.

The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of \\nEastern Anatolia.

An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \\njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \\nof the hills.\\n\\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \\nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \\nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \\nor missing... \\n\\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \\nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \\nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \\nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \\nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \\nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\\n\\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \\nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \\nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \\nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \\nrepeated blasts.\\n\\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \\nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \\nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \\nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \\nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \\nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \\n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \\nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\\n\\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \\nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \\nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \\ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\\'s job was to land in the mountains \\nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \\nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\\n\\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \\narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \\nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \\nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \\nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \\nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \\npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\\n\\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \\nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \\nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \\ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \\nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \\non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \\ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \\nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\\n\\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \\ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \\ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \\nmortis. They had been shot.\\n\\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \\nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY \\nDECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n'),\n",

Boghosian, \"Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity\\nMeeting,\" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.\\n\\nATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,\\nincluding the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both\\nArmenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the \\nArmenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new\\nArmenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during\\nthe 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And\\njudging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these\\npolitical groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian\\nCause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.\\n\\nThe International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of\\nthe Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed\\nby younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the\\narmed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia\\n(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern\\ncountries and the United States although some of these branches appear to\\nhave gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks\\nof ASALA...\\n\\nVoicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian\\npeople, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of\\nthe party and the Greek member of the Permanent People\\'s Tribunal...\\nExplaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement \\nwas Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam \\nAbu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement\\'s continued \\nsupport of the Armenians\\' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, \\npledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be \\nopen to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. \\nAbu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that \\nhis organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that\\nthis policy will continue. \"The doors of our camps are always open to \\nArmenian freedom fighters,\" he affirmed.\\n\\nAmong the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son\\nof Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;\\ntwo members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the\\nspecific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of\\nthe Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist\\nparty, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,\\na number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the\\nEuropean Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among\\nthose who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow\\nthe deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.\\n\\nMore than significant was the large number of messages received by the \\norganizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary\\nMovement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General\\nCommand; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation\\nMovement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist\\nLabor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other\\ninternational groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-\\nPalestinian conflict.\\n\\n                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM\\n\\nAmong messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary\\nFederation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction\\nand assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to\\nforeign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the\\nArmenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will\\ncontinue to \"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\"\\nto expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \"Bureau.\"\\nThe message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that\\nexists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,\\nopen supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.\\n\\nThe Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the\\nGreek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.\\nThe headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have\\nturned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who\\nprefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...\\n\\nNow any comment?\\n\\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\\n#Subject: Re:Addressing.....\\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\\n\\n \\nIn article <1993Apr7.225058.12073@urartu.sdpa.org> dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (David Davidian) writes:\\n>In article <1993Apr7.030636.7473@news.columbia.edu> vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu\\n>(Vedat  Dogan) wrote in response to article <1993Mar31.141308.28476@urartu.\\n>11sdpa.org> dbd@urartu.sdpa.org (David Davidian) writes:\\n>\\n \\n>[(*] Source: \"Adventures in the Near East, 1918-1922\" by A.

The United States\\n delegation of General Harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came \\n to take refuge with Kazim Karabekir\\'s soldiers, hungry and miserable, \\n their children and wives, their properties destroyed, and the delegation\\n was a witness to the cruelties. Many Muslim villages have been destroyed\\n by the soldiers of Armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns\\n before the eyes of Karabekir\\'s troops and the people. When it was hoped\\n that this operation would end, unfortunately since the beginning of \\n February the cruelties inflicted on the Muslim population of the region\\n of Shuraghel, Akpazar, Zarshad, and Childir have increased. According\\n to documented information, 28 Muslim villages have been destroyed in the\\n aforementioned region, more than 2,000 people have been slaughtered,\\n many possessions and livestock have been seized, young Muslim women\\n have been taken to Kars and Gumru, thousands of women and children who\\n were able to flee their villages were beaten, raped and massacred in the\\n mountains, and this aggression against the properties, lives, chastity \\n and honour of the Muslims continued. It was the responsibility of the\\n Armenian Government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order \\n to alleviate the tensions of Muslim public opinion due to the atrocities \\n committed by the Armenians, that the possessions taken from the Muslims\\n be returned and that indemnities be paid, that the properties, lives,\\n and honour of the Muslims be protected.\"\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n'),\n",

Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the\\n24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities\\ncommitted during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which\\nhas been converted into a museum.\\n\\nAN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY\\nGREEK TERRORISTS\\n\\nThe date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the\\nGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been\\ngoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men\\nand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal\\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\\nbloodshed...\\n\\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\\n\\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\\nduring the same terrible event.\\n\\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\\nAyshe\\'s  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\\nheard one of the Major\\'s children moan, then I fainted.\\n\\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\\nbrutally murdered.\\n\\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\\nunder the double-bed.\\n\\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\\nwere all wounded.\\n\\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o\\'clock in  the morning.  I\\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\\n\\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\\nAyshe and her daughter.\\n\\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\\n\\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\\ndetention. They then released me.\"\\n\\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS\\'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\\n\\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\\ndays.\\n\\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\\nterrible sights.\\n\\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\\nchild\\'s bicycle lay in a corner.\\n\\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\\n\\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\\nhead.\\n\\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\\n\\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\\n\\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \"DAILY EXPRESS\")\\n\\n\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\"\\n\\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\\n\\n\\n Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus. \\n Date : 1 January, 1964. \\n\\n IL GIARNO (Italy)\\n \\n THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.\\n\\n Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues.

December 1992 Author: Avi Raz\\n\\nSubject: Torture\\n\\nTitle of article: Moderate physical pressure\\n\\nSeveral times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation\\nroom in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,\\nbeaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a\\nShabak agent \\'Captain Louis\\', chatting on the phone with his wife.\\n\"At those moments\", Omar said, \"I felt that he was like a\\nhumanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat\\nme and say, \\'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed\\nyourself\\' and I understood that he was not really a human being\".\\n\\nIn late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm\\nprison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. \"Among the Jews,\\nas among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people\", he said\\nafter his release, \"but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations\\nrooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that\\nhe is a human being\". Although he left the detention installation\\nin Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\"I sat at home for ten days. My\\nhands shook from nerves\"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He\\ngot out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned\\nto normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.\\n\\nIn contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released\\nseven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the\\nShabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn\\'t speak or\\nreact. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early\\nAugust and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left\\nit one day later - dead. \"We have recently received an especially\\nlarge number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at\\nthe Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\", noted\\nDr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and\\nPalestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)\\n\\nThe right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan\\nSaber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely\\nfearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated\\nin Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would\\nreturn him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.\\n\\n(...follow description of tortures....)\\n\\nOmar, a tall bearded man, was silent. \"I do not want to talk about\\nit\", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and\\nashamed, he spoke: \"Sometimes he beats you and beats you until\\nyou\\'ll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of\\nanother interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,\\nand the last interrogator says:\" Now you are kissing my hand, and\\nlater if I want, you will kiss my ass.\"\\n\\nThese things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,\\nlocated within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West\\nBank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In\\nearly March the IDF allowed representatives of B\\'Tselem, the\\nIsraeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to\\nvisit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation\\nwing. \"The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely\\nunder Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by\\nit\", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho\\'an, the commander of the\\ninstallation, according to the internal report written by B\\'tselem\\nmember, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe\\'er,\\ngoverning commander of the prison system in the Central Command,\\nwas quoted in the report:  \"There is an ethical problem here - no\\none can enter the interrogation wing\".\\n\\nTransl. by I.

But Turks did not do so. \\nThey obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody \"to worship in their own\\nway\" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,\\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \\npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \\nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\\ncountries.\"[1]\\n\\n\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions.

This flaw\\nis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples\\nof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account\\nof his religion.

On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate\\nvictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that\\nin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and\\nPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been\\nliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,\\nand are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the\\ncruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes.

Although the mosque is superior to the church and\\nthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is\\nmore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition \\nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \\nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in\\nthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical\\nprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing\\ntheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them\\nwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of \\npriests.\" (A.

Did you ever read newspaper at all?\\n\\n\\n\"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\"\\n\\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February\\'s killings of Azeris by Armenians\\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\\n\\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\\n\\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\\nAzerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\\ndead.\\n\\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\\n\\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\\nand products to wash the dead.\"\\n\\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will\\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\\nlawyer said at his small office.\\n\\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\\nFebruary.\\n\\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\\npilot.\\n\\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\\nreturn.\"\\n\\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\\n\\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/\\'92\\n\\n\\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\\n\\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\\n\\n\"I\\'m still  wearing the same  clothes, I don\\'t have  any others,\"\\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\\nHojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\\nbe alive.\"\\n\\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\\nedge of Karabakh.\\n\\n\"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\\nmachine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.\\n\\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\\n\\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\\n\\n\"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\\nfire,\" Mr Sadikov said.\\n\\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\\n67-year-old elder brother.\\n\\n\"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\"\\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We\\nhave never got any of the bodies back.\"\\n\\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group\\'s\\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\\n\\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\\n\\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\\nsoon to flee.\\n\\n\"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I\\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment.

Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?\\nWere these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?\\n\\nThe nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British\\nJournalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times\\narticle. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before\\nTurkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures\\nof people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.\\n\\nEven the Armenian Radio couldn\\'t claim these \"lies.\" They are saying\\n\"exaggeration.\" That means \\'\\'somethings\\'\\' have happened but the\\nsituation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu\\ntown was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin\\'s\\n3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...\\n\\nThe massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of\\nthis massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.\\n\\nSome of the western press\\', led by some French Newspapers, ability\\nto \\'\\'close their eyes\\'\\' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.\\n\\nYesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday\\'s print\\nno news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the\\nFrench TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag\\nwas \\'\\'The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.\\'\\'\\n\\nThe age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots\\nof organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security\\nand Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human\\nrights violations. International reactions must be made with international\\ncooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming\\nto be civilized.\\n\\nCould there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the\\nright to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where\\nis the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,\\njournalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such\\nas France who are fast to claim leadership of \"human rights?\"\\nWhere are you?\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Questions to Israelis\\n\\n\\nDear Josh\\n\\nI appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.\\n\\nHaving said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.\\n\\n1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards\\nidentify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.\\ncitizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are\\njust trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic\\ncountry where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or\\nreligious identity to any public official who so requests ?\\n\\n2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all\\nkinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.\\nYou did not respond to my question.\\n\\n3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is\\ninteresting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear\\nweapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?\\n\\n4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a\\nMa'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases\\nlike Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about\\nthose about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and\\nimprisoned.\\n\\n5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status\\nof the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I\\nunderstand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for\\nthe occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law).\\nThe law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so,\\nwhy doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?\\n\\n6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return\\nconflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands\\nof non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under\\nIsrael control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from\\nreturning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also\\nleft, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to\\nreturn. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ?\\nIs the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge\\nsomewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in\\nhis homeland ?\\n\\n7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an\\norder for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that\\ninformation, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all\\ninhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These\\nexpulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other\\natrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by\\nIsraeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the\\nPalestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University\\nPress. Is this book available in your library ?\\n\\n8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in\\nIsraeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very\\nlittle evidence available about that. As much as I know, many\\nArabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are\\nnot accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want\\nArabs ?\\n\\n9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was\\nwhether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to\\ndiscourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but\\nevaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants\\nto keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious\\ncommunities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish\\ncivil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests\\nto officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a\\nsecular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.\\n\\n\\nI would be glad to have some more input from you after these\\ncomments.\\n\\nElias\\n\\n\"),\n",

Hmm...let\\'s see: \\n\\n  Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that \\n  led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to \\n  be surprised not to know). \\n  It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid. \\n\\n  What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis   over \\n  200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen \\n  if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct \\n  or indirect result of western envolvement. \\n\\nPossibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on\\nGreenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged\\nimpartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental\\nconsequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely*\\nignoring Iraq\\'s horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping\\nof millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of\\nover 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of\\nwork on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the\\nGreenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real\\nnumber seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of\\nKuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I\\'ve\\nincluded an article I recently posted below, but this is really old\\nnews.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only\\na few months after the war, but it was hardly reported. \\n\\nFor the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to\\nkill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait. \\n\\nThe favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at\\nMutla\\'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media\\nplaying into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The\\ndestruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla\\' was portrayed as an all-out\\nslaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy\\nwas bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. \\n Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled\\non foot. \\n\\nFurthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn\\'t invaded\\nis completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly) \\n that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundreds\\nof thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*. \\nYou *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait,  Ali Majid,\\nwas his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the\\nKurds  in the late 80\\'s and, more recently, the Shi\\'a.    Yet, when it\\ncomes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel.  In your estimate,\\nhe would\\'ve killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started. \\nWhat a joke! \\n\\n\\nAPn  03/09 0006  Iraq War Dead \\n\\nCopyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved. \\n\\nBy NICK LUDINGTON \\n Associated Press Writer \\n   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended, the world was\\ntold that \\nas many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point, even Baghdad put \\nthe toll that high, as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private. \\n   But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the \\nPentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public. \\nNow, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may\\nhave been \\nas low as 1,500. \\n   That conclusion by John Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the \\nquarterly magazine Foreign Policy, represents the lowest estimate yet\\nfrom U.S. \\ndefense sources. \\n   The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of \\nvastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended.\\nClaims \\nfor a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down. \\n   Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking \\npictures of Iraq\\'s disastrous retreat from Kuwait, arguments have continued \\nunabated about what really happened in the Gulf War. \\n   Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that \\noriginally were aired. More that a year ago, Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles\\nHorner, \\nthe commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War, said he believed the Iraqi \\nmilitary death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war. \\n   The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of \\nIraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in\\nJanuary and \\nFebruary 1991. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisher\\nreiterated \\npast statements that \"there just isn\\'t a number,\" that is credible. \\n   But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops \\nkilled, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar \\nwith the Pentagon\\'s reports. \\n   Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 British, 9 \\nby American fire; 2 Frenchmen, 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies. \\n   Of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the Army\\'s \\nreluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted Patriot air defense \\nsystem was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq\\'s Scud missiles. \\nThe Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the \\nPatriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent. \\n   The success record of the Navy\\'s Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used \\nagainst targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more \\nmodest than initially indicated by the Pentagon. \\n   The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a\\nMay 1991 \\nreport by the environmental group Greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000 \\nIraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians \\nwere also killed. \\n   The same month, published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency \\nestimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the\\nair and \\nground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate \\ncould be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction. \\n   But as more information became available, those figures gradually were \\nrevised downward. \\n   The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000 \\nwounded after a review last year. \\n   But Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign\\nPolicy, \\nestimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives\\nas low as \\n1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded. \\n   Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of\\nbodies found \\nand buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews.\\nHe noted \\nthat only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded. \\n   Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were \\ncaptured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. Using a conservative \\nratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to Third World armies like\\nIraq, he \\nset battlefield deaths at 1,500. \\n   \"Maybe the figures are too low,\" he wrote. \"Maybe the real death toll\\non the \\nbattlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. Even then, the evidence\\nsuggests a \\ndeath toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000.\" \\n   In an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base\\nbecause it \\nwould mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of \\noperations were casualties. \\n   He said today\\'s bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology, \\nbut rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n'),\n",

An occupying government is still a govern-\\nment, and the Palestinians have made it quite clear that their goal is\\nnot simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that don\\'t con-\\nfer citizenship (which is your own determination of the distinction) but\\nto wipe it out entirely (and, not incidentally, the entire Jewish population\\nit rules with it).

For that matter, isn\\'t\\na requirement for the term democracy in the United States, which doesn\\'t\\nlet non-citizens vote either. Both the United States and Israel have\\nprocesses whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship, with a great\\ndeal of effort and a modicum of screening -- it\\'s just that it isn\\'t\\nautomatic for living in the territories. It isn\\'t automatic for living\\nin New York, either.\\n\\nThat said, suit yourself. Having never considered democracy the ultimate\\nin Good In This World, I could care less if you feel like calling Israel,\\nor America, or anywhere else, a democracy. Personally, I withhold the\\nterm from Israel for the same reason I withhold it from Britain... the\\nparliamentary system is a serious handicap.\\n\\n>then Mr. Frank would be correct.  As the current government neither\\n>is willing to \\n>enfrachise the vast majority of individuals in the territories or to\\n>allow these people to have the right to self determination it is not\\n>a civil war or THEIR government, rather it is resitance to a FOREIGN\\n>occupier.\\n\\nAgain, suit yourself. In which case Israel is *not* attacking its own\\npeople, it is fighting a war on foreign soil, in which case the residents\\nare entitled to play rough, yes -- but Israel\\'s allowed to get just as\\nrough, within the bare limits of the rules of war. This includes, among\\nother things, the right to shoot or bomb *anyone* a national of the coun-\\ntry in question who is fighting them (which permits mass frontal assault\\non all rock-throwers), along with the right to take out any installation\\nof military importance (certain villages with too-good fortifications can\\nbe handled by aerial bombing, as can waterways since they count as supply\\nlines to the enemy), and the right to do anything whatsoever to whatever\\nconstitutes a government that they can lay hands on (if Hamas is trying\\nto set up as the ruling party, let them beware). \\n\\nIf this is not the scenario you want, I recommend you go back to calling\\nit a civil war. Civil wars have to be handled nicer. You cannot say the\\nPalestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign\\nnation and still call Israel a government who is treating its own people\\ncruelly.

Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina\\ntherefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; they\\njoined Tito\\'s Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at \\nless than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time.\\n\\nAfter WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended\\nfrom Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.

Dobrica Cosic, the current\\npresident of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought to\\nprevent the category \"Muslim\" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the\\nnext census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.

I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.

Is that so hard to\\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \\nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \\nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiers\\nyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \\nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\\nIsrael\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \\nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n|> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a \\n|> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing\\n|> justifies murder.\\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n|> similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ?

For example, I\\n       bought an iron for $11:00 here in Canada, later I bought a garbage\\n       bucket for our kitchen for nearly $12:00!!! The bucket has been made\\n       from  petroleum products, and I bet the producing country has not\\n       received even 5 cents for the amount of the oil used in that bucket,\\n       while the western producer, thank to the monopoly they have in \\n       technology and are trying to maintain it in all fields of science by \\n       methods you saw in that program, makes billions of dollars every\\n       year.\\n\\n     - Iran\\'s hydro-potential is something around 10,000 MW which won\\'t be\\n       enough in less than 10 years. Even exploiting this potential takes\\n       billions of dollars and so many years, which can not catch up with\\n       the rate of growth in Iran\\'s energy production.\\n\\n     - More important than all above, the science is not the belonging of any\\n       specific group or nation. It is none of anybody\\'s business if a nation\\n       want\\'s to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, if that nation has\\n       accepted international monitoring, something which Iran has done.\\n\\n>>    4- A key point in program\\'s justifications is trying to disvalidate as\\n>>    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\\n>>    Iran\\'s different sites.

The following letter, which represents a small portion \\nof the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical \\ndocuments, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, \\nwas sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, \\nprogram directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and \\nradio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide \\nof 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people \\nof Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the \\nlost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is \\nmourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their \\nlives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations \\nmay live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and \\nprosperously.\\n\\n------------------------- letter ----------------------------------\\n\\nDuring the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nhas planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which \\nnot only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the \\nmethod used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, \\nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \\nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \\nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\\n\\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \\nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \\nGenocide.\\n\\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \\nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\\n\\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\\n\\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\\n\\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \\nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \\nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \\nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \\nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \\ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \\nof the Turkish Genocide.\\n\\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \\ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\\n\\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \\nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \\nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \\nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\\n\\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \\nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \\n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \\ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \\narmed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon\\nall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in \\nthe political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary\\nof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.'

The following letter, which represents a small portion \\nof the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical \\ndocuments, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, \\nwas sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, \\nprogram directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and \\nradio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide \\nof 2.5 million Muslim people.

This year the Turkish Nation is \\nmourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their \\nlives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations \\nmay live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and \\nprosperously.\\n\\n------------------------- letter ----------------------------------\\n\\nDuring the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nhas planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which \\nnot only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the \\nmethod used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, \\nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \\nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \\nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\\n\\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \\nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \\nGenocide.\\n\\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \\nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\\n\\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\\n\\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\\n\\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \\nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \\nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \\nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \\nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \\ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \\nof the Turkish Genocide.\\n\\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \\ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\\n\\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \\nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \\nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \\nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\\n\\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \\nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \\n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \\ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \\narmed struggle.

For the sake of brevity, I\\'ll present them in some separate\\n    points.\\n\\n    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of\\n    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the\\n    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:\\n\\n    - It was alleged that:\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah\\'s technological\\n    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of\\n    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \"!\\n    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives \\n    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology\\n    in Iran after revolution.\\n\\n    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors\\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen\\n    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in\\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and\\n    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.\\n\\n    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi\\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most\\n    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total\\n    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million\\n    dead left from the war.\\n\\n    - The translation of Iranian officials\\' talks are not 100% true. For\\n    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \" It hurts me to\\n    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\" The \\n    translator says: \" It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly \\n    research.\"!\\n\\n    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\\n    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to \\n    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran\\'s\\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.\\n\\n    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of \\n    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the\\n    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed\\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account\\n    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its\\n    potential role in improvement of Iran\\'s industries and eventually the\\n    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\\n    in scientific and industrial efforts.\\n\\n    4- A key point in program\\'s justifications is trying to disvalidate as\\n    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\\n    Iran\\'s different sites. They say: \"We are not sure if the places visited\\n    by IAEA are the real ones or not\" !, or \" We can not rely on IAEA\\'s\\n    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq\\'s nuclear\\n    activities before\" as if they didn\\'t know that Iraq was trying to build\\n    nuclear weapons!\\n\\n    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the\\n    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,\\n    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking\\n    from the absolute knowledge!\\n\\n       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\\n    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to\\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.\\n\\n\\nMohammad\\n\\n  \\n    [*] International Atomic Energy Agency\\n  \\n'),\n",

The following are quotes of his speech: \\n\\n``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before \\nIraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in \\nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \\nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \\narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \\nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \\nof Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \\nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \\nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \\nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \\nafter Kuwait itself.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \\nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \\nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \\nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \\nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq\\'s \\nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \\n\\n\\nOrigins of Kuwait \\n\\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \\nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \\nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \\nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait\\'s name is derived from al-Kut which means \\nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \\nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \\nestablishment. \\n\\nThe \\'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of \\'Utub, settled in Kuwait \\nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \\nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \\nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for \\'Utub. \\n\\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \\nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \\nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \\ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \\nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \\nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr\\'s chart \\nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \\ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \\n1750-1800. pub.1965. \\n\\nAl-Sabah (\\'Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \\nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima\\'s conclusions in his well \\ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \\nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \\nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \\nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \\nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \\ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha\\'s expedition against the \\nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \\nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \\nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of \\'Utbi external policy \\nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \\nGulf.\\'\\' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \\nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \\n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.\\'\\' (p.183) \\n\\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \\nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \\ntried to win the support of Kuwait\\'s Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \\nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \\nGulf area. \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait \\n\\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \\nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \\nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \\nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \\n\\nAbdullah\\' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \\nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \\nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \\nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \\nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \\n\\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \\nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \\nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \\nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \\njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \\nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \\nwar against Su\\'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \\na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \\nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \\nthose who had signed it. \\n\\n\\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \\nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \\nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \\n\\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \\nUniversity, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \\n\\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \\nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \\n\\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \\nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \\nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa\\'immaqam [representative] on \\nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \\nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \\nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \\nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \\nterritory. \\n\\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \\nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \\nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \\nfather\\'s agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \\nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \\nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \\nentitled to receive. \\n\\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \\nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \\nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \\nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \\nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \\nhim the title of Qa\\'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \\nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \\nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \\nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \\nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \\nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \\nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh\\'s \\ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \\n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \\nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \\nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.\\'\\' \\n\\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \\nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \\nexplained above. However, Kuwait\\'s relations with the Ottoman \\nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \\ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \\npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \\nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \\nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \\nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \\nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \\nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,\\'\\' which had been \\nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.\\'\\' \\nThis description of Pelly\\'s reception indicates that to a certain \\ndegree it was run according to protocol. \\n\\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \\nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \\nthe judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the \\nCazee\\'s decision.\\'\\' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there \\nseems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an \\narmy.\\'\\' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the \\ncountry, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: \\n\\nWhen my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I \\nshall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, \\nbut I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other \\nstates around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or \\nill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and \\nthough you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile \\nand still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.\\'\\' \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--4 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nThe British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,\\'\\' but \\nin October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have \\nweakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \\nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \\nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \\nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \\nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \\nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \\nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \\nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \\ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \\n\\nAfter Edmunds\\' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \\nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \\nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \\nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \\nTherefore, they considered that Jabir\\'s conduct did not indicate any \\nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \\n\\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \\nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \\nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as \\'Umar Ibn \\'Ufaisan, the \\nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \\nsought refuge in Kuwait. \\n\\nProtection of refugees seeking political \\nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \\nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \\nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait\\'s independence \\nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \\nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \\nneighbors. \\n\\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \\nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \\nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \\n\\nAs to Kuwait\\'s position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \\nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \\nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \\neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \\n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

Philbrick had become an\\nAmerican folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting\\ncolleagues.  It was a time when Hollywood produced more than 30 films\\nportraying the informer as the quintessential American patriot.  In\\nBoston, where Philbrick led three lives as an FBI informant, Communist\\nParty member, and private citizen, the mayor even proclaimed a Herbert\\nPhilbrick Day and presented the spy with a plaque.\\n\\nFor Bullock, a shy young man who was coming to terms with his\\nhomosexuality in the straight-arrow \\'50s, the life of a double agent\\nwas the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the Communist\\nmenace.\\n\\n\"I was fascinated with Herbert Philbrick,\" Bullock recently told\\nfederal investigators, \"and so I thought I would try to infiltrate the\\nCommunist Part.  In 1957, I went to the Sixth World Youth and Student\\nFestival in Moscow with the American delegation.  I gave them [the FBI\\na full report on it when I returned, along with some photos I took of\\nsome Soviet military vehicles.\"\\n\\nBullock was hooked.  For the next two years, he worked as an unpaid\\ninformant for the FBI.  But he found his true calling when he became a\\npaid spy for the Anti-Defamation League in 1960.  Now his activities\\nare at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent\\nAmerican history -- a scandal that may end with the ADL\\'s criminal\\nindictment in San Francisco.\\n\\nOver a 30-year period, he compiled computer files for the ADL on 9876\\nindividuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes,\\nincluding the NAACP, the Rainbow Coalition, ACLU, the American Indian\\nMovement, the Center for Investigative Reporting, Pacifica, ACT UP,\\nPalestinian and Arab groups, Sandinista solidarity groups, Americans\\nfor Peace Now, and anti-apartheid organizations.  Bullock, who even\\nspied on the recently slain South African nationalist Chris Hani when\\nhe visited the Bay Area in April 1991, sold many of his ADL files on\\nanti-apartheid activists to South African intelligence.  Meanwhile,\\nbetween 1985 and 1993, the ADL paid him nearly $170,000, using a\\nprominent Beverly Hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its\\nfinancial relationship with Bullock.\\n\\nLast month, police raided ADL offices in Los Angeles and San\\nFrancisco, as well as Bullock\\'s home, confiscating computer files and\\nboxes of documents.  According to court records, Bullock\\'s files\\ncontained the driver\\'s license and vehicle registration information,\\nin addition to criminal histories on individuals -- much of which was\\nallegedly stolen from the FBI and police computers.  Bullock, 58, told\\nthe FBI that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base\\nhad been given to the San Francisco ADL office.  \"Based on the\\nevidence,\" says Inspector Ron Roth, in a police affidavit, \"I believe\\nthat Roy Bullock and ADL had numerous peace officers supplying them\\nwith confidential criminal and DMV information.\"\\n\\nWhat\\'s more, the San Francisco D.A. is investigating Bullock for\\ntapping phones, accessing answering machines, and assuming false\\nidentities to infiltrate organizations.  Documents seized from\\nBullock\\'s home also contained evidence of his forays into Bay Area\\ntrash cans: He had the names and phone numbers of employees at the\\nChristic Institute in San Francisco, as well as telephone message\\nslips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers),\\noffice correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the\\nsenders, and inter-office memos.  He also had receipts from Christic\\nInstitute\\'s bank accounts at Wells Fargo and Eureka Federal Savings,\\nas well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees, the\\ndates, and amounts.  Bullock even knew the balance in the Christic\\nInstitute\\'s checking account.\\n\\nInvestigations by the FBI and police in San Francisco have revealed\\nthat the ADL has shared at least some of its spy gathering material\\nwith Israeli government officials.  What\\'s more, Israel apparently used\\ntips from the ADL to detain Palestinian Americans who travelled there.\\n\\n                            *     *     *\\n\\nThe ADL was established in New York City in 1913 to defend Jews, and\\nlater other minority groups, from discrimination.  It led the fight\\nagainst racist and fascist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and the\\nAmerican Nazi Party, and in the 1960s championed the civil rights\\nmovement.\\n\\nBut there was also a darker side.  In the late 1940s, the ADL spied on\\nleftists and Communists, and shared investigative files with the House\\nCommittee on Un-American Activities and the FBI.  The ADL swung\\nsharply to the right during the Reagan administration, becoming a\\nbastion of neoconservatism.  To Irwin Suall, a repentant Trotskyite\\nwho heads the ADL\\'s powerful Fact Finding Department, the real danger\\nto Jews is posed not by the right -- but by a coalition of leftists,\\nblacks, and Arabs, who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in\\nAmerica, as well as the state of Israel.  In the tradition of his\\nideological soulmate William Casey, Suall directed the ADL\\'s vast\\nnetwork of informants, who were given code names like \"Scumbag,\"\\n\"Ironside,\" and -- for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in Atlanta\\n-- \"Flipper.\"\\n\\nFor years, journalists and liberal members of the Jewish community\\nknew the ADL spied on right-wing hate groups.  As long as the targets\\nwere anti-Semitic organizations like the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon\\nLarouche, no one seemed to be particularly troubled.  But the Bullock\\ncase reveals that the ADL also spied on groups that have a nonviolent,\\nand progressive orientation.  This apparent massive violation of civil\\nliberties may end with the ADL\\'s criminal indictment in San Francisco,\\nwhere the investigation began.  The human rights group faces possible\\ncriminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts, including an\\nindictment for gaining illegal access to police computers.  Says one\\nsource close to the West Coast investigation, \"It is 99 per cent\\ncertain that the ADL will be indicted.\"\\n\\nIn the wake of the San Francisco investigation, police probes of ADL\\nspying are spreading to other parts of the country.  \"We have received\\nnumerous complaints about ADL [spying],\" says Sam Adams, a\\nspokesperson for the mayor\\'s office in Portland, Oregon.\\n\\nOn April 16, the Harlem-based Black United Fund of New York, and\\nAfrican American self-help group that Bullock allegedly spied on,\\nwrote District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, requesting \"an immediate\\ninvestigation\" of the ADL.  \"The ADL\\'s actions cause great concern, as\\nit is a direct and flagrant violation -- at minimum -- of our civil\\nrights....We call upon you to join with the District Attorney of San\\nFrancisco to...bring and end to this latest form of McCarthyism.\"\\n\\nGerald McKelvey, a spokesperson for Morgenthau\\'s office, says, \"We\\nhave no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation.\"\\nMcKelvey adds that Morgenthau offered to assist the FBI and the San\\nFrancisco D.A.\\'s office on their pending investigation.  \"They have\\nnot, so far, asked for our assistance.\"\\n\\nThe ADL acknowledges sharing information on violence-prone groups with\\nlaw enforcement officials.  It also admits to maintaining extensive\\nfiles on a wide variety of organizations, but says, in a two-page\\npress release, \"The vast majority of ADL\\'s files are composed of news\\nclips, magazine articles, books, journals, and other documents....\"\\n\\n\"ADL has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance\\nviolations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency,\\nand the process by which the League gathers information is presently\\nunder review to insure that no laws are being violated.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s what the ADL says for public consumption.  But morale is so low\\nthat its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits.  And\\neven as other Jewish groups circle the wagons around the ADL in a show\\nof solidarity, many do so holding their noses.  More than a few Jewish\\nofficials privately say the ADL has to decide whether it is a human\\nrights group or a secret police agency.\\n\\n\"The ADL is regarded both inside the Jewish community and outside the\\nJewish community as the definitive source of information on anti-\\nSemitism and extremist groups,\" says Daniel Levitas, the former\\nexecutive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta-\\nbased group that monitors anti-Semitism, racism, and hate groups.\\n\"One of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely\\ntainted the ADL\\'s credibility and reputation with regard to its\\nobjectivity.  This scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the\\nJewish community at large because people regard the ADL as synonymous\\nwith American Jewry.\"\\n\\n                            *     *     *\\n\\nBullock\\'s talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well\\nwith the ADL\\'s Cold War worldview.  In 1960, he moved to Southern\\nCalifornia where he became an ADL spy for $75.00 a week.  Bullock\\nalmost always used his real name when snooping, although he once\\ncalled himself Elmer Fink when corresponding with supporters of\\nAlabama governor George Wallace.  Bullock provided the ADL\\'s office in\\nLos Angeles with written reports, which were transmitted to Fact\\nFinding Department head Irwin Suall, according to court records.\\nUnder Suall\\'s stewardship, Fact Finding Department had become the\\nADL\\'s heart and soul.  Located at ADL national headquarters across\\nfrom the United Nations, the department had assembled a vast library\\non \"hate groups,\" culling material from publications, speeches, and\\ninformants reports.\\n\\nBullock was more than adept at leading a double life.  Not long after\\nmoving to California, he ingratiated himself with a woman in the John\\nBirch Society who helped him gain access to the group\\'s Boston office.\\nThere, he found a file the right-wingers were keeping on the ADL.  The\\ndiscovery gave rise to speculation in the ADL New York office that\\nthey had somehow been penetrated by the Birchers.\\n\\nBullock focused almost exclusively on right-wing extremist groups\\nuntil the early 1970s when ADL L.A. head Milton Sinn was replaced by\\nHarvey Schechter, who encouraged him to target the left as well.  A\\nfew years later, Bullock moved to the Castro District in San Francisco\\nwhere he posed as an art dealer.  And ADL fact finder who had\\ninfiltrated the local Arab community had just been exposed.  When the\\nensuing scandal died down, Bullock was ordered by the ADL to penetrate\\nthe Arabs.\\n\\nThe ADL was especially concerned about the American-Arab Anti-\\nDiscrimination Committee, founded by the former South Dakota senator\\nJames Abourezk to combat Arab-bashing.  In a page out of the CIA\\'s\\ndirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization, Bullock\\njoined the ADC, and then recruited Nazis into the group, apparently\\ntrying to discredit it, according to published reports.\\n\\nIn 1987, the ADL sent Bullock to attend the National Association of\\nArab Americans annual congress in Washington.  According to court\\ndocuments, Bullock was told to find the source of the group\\'s funds.\\nBullock was unable to \"follow the money.\"  But he did such a good job\\nat ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a NAAA\\ndelegation that visited Congress member Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\nIt\\'s not surprising that the ADL penetrated Arab organizations.  But\\nonly acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like ACT UP.  As\\nfar as Bullock was concerned, gay groups in San Francisco were heavily\\ninfiltrated by what he called \"gay left revolutionaries,\" prompting\\nhim to write about their activities for the ADL.\\n\\nBullock soon expanded his horizons, moving into the shadowy realm of\\nforeign espionage after Richard Hirschhaut, the head of ADL\\'s San\\nFrancisco office, introduced him to Thomas Gerard in 1986.  Gerard was\\nthen a detective with the San Francisco Police Department\\'s\\nIntelligence Unit.  Gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the\\nCIA in El Salvador in the early 1980s, where he apparently had more\\nthan a passing interest in right-wing death squads.  (Police searching\\nGerard\\'s briefcase found extensive CIA literature about torture and\\ninterrogation, photos of blindfolded and chained men, as well as\\npassports made out to Gerard in 10 different names, including Thomas\\nClouseau.  From a remote jungle island redoubt in the Philippines\\nwhere he fled last November, Gerard told the Los Angeles Times that he\\nwill blow the lid off the CIA\\'s involvement with Latin American death\\nsquads if he is indicted in the ADL spy case.)\\n\\nAfter their very first encounter in the ADL office, Gerard and Bullock\\nhad lunch at McDonald\\'s, \"I liked Tom right off,\" Bullock later told a\\nSan Francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation\\nwas obtained by the _Voice_.  \"Tom is a very charming, roguish\\ncharacter, with a great deal of integrity.  Let me say here, I\\nconsider Tom Gerard one of the finest policemen I\\'ve ever worked\\nwith, absolutely.  Honest, capable, intelligent and 100 percent\\nAmerican.\"\\n\\nBefore long, Bullock was providing Gerard with confidential ADL\\nreports on various groups and individuals.  In turn, Gerard gave\\nBullock classified police intelligence files on local Arab Americans,\\nskinheads, and others.  Bullock told the FBI that Gerard\\'s material\\nended up in his ADL reports.  \"I would say 99 percent of the data that\\nI got was name, address, and sometimes physical description.  Criminal\\nhistory, very rarely,\" Bullock told investigators.  Gerard also gave\\nBullock a chart that outlined a vast network of Bay Area Arab American\\nbusinessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to Middle East\\nterror groups, as well as surveillance photos of Arab Americans\\nreceiving weapons training overseas.  Bullock claims that U.S. Customs\\nin New York gave Gerard the photos.  \"It was understood that Bullock\\nwould be very careful with what he did with the information Gerard\\ngave him, and that Bullock would not release it except to the ADL or\\nother law enforcement officers,\" says an FBI report.\\n\\nThere was nothing unusual about Bullock\\'s cozy relationship with law\\nenforcement.  By the mid-1980s, the ADL was swapping files with\\nhundreds of \"official friends,\" the organization\\'s euphemism for U.S.\\nlaw enforcement and intelligence sources.  The ADL\\'s relationship with\\nthe FBI\\'s counterterrorism office was so close that ADL\\'s reports on\\nArab American group\\'s covert ties to Middle East terrorists were \"must\\nreading.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s no accident that police found a 1986 classified FBI report\\nentitled \"Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)--New\\nYork Area\" while searching the ADL\\'s San Francisco office.  In 1987,\\nADL spooks investigated seven Palestinians and a Kenyan studying in\\nCalifornia universities on student visas.  When the ADL discovered\\nthey were disseminating PFLP literature, it informed the FBI, which in\\nturn took the case to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\\nAfter the INS ordered the students deported as subversives, ADL\\nregional director David Lehrer gloated in the _Los Angeles Times_\\nabout his office\\'s cooperation with law enforcement, although he\\'s\\nbackpedaling now.  The \"Los Angeles 8\" deportation is still under\\nappeal.\\n\\n                            *     *     *\\n\\nWhile the ADL worked quietly with America\\'s top cops, it enjoyed\\nsimilar ties with Israel\\'s spy agencies -- a charge that ADL leaders\\nvehemently deny.  But as early as July 7, 1961, ADL director Benjamin\\nEpstein wrote to B\\'nai B\\'rith executive secretary Saul Joftes,\\nrequesting $25,000 for his investigators.  \"Our information,\" he\\nboasted to Joftes, \"in addition to being essential for our own\\noperations, has been of great value and service to both the United\\nStates Department and the Israeli Government.  All data have been made\\navailable to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are\\nthe source.\"\\n\\nIn 1987, the ADL came under FBI scrutiny in the wake of the Pollard\\nspy scandal.  While assigned to the Navy\\'s Anti-Terrorist Alert\\nCenter, where he had access to the most closely guarded U.S. secrets,\\nJonathan Pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for\\nIsrael, which, according to federal prosecutors, \"could fill a room\\nthe size of a large closet...ten feet by six feet by six feet.\"\\nPollard\\'s handler was Avi Sella, an Israeli air force colonel whose\\nwife worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.  Pollard later wrote to\\nfriends that a prominent ADL leader was deeply involved in the Israeli\\nspy operation.\\n\\nWhile there is no proof that anyone connected with the ADL was\\ninvolved with Pollard, there is evidence that the ADL freely passes\\ninformation to Israeli intelligence.  In March 1993, the FBI\\ninterrogated David Gurvitz, an ADL fact finder in Los Angeles until\\n1992 when he was fired by Suall for illegally obtaining police\\ninformation to use against a rival at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.\\nThe FBI pointedly asked Gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information\\nto Israel.  Gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a law\\nenforcement contact that Michael Elias, allegedly a member of a\\nradical PLO faction, was scheduled to travel from San Francisco\\nInternational Airport en route to Haifa.  Gurvitz phoned the deputy\\nIsraeli consul general in L.A. with the information.  \"Later the same\\nday,\" according to a 15-page FBI interview of Gurvitz obtained by the\\n_Voice_, \"Gurvitz was called back by another man, who said he was from\\nthe Israeli Consulate, and who asked Gurvitz to repeat the information\\nabout Elias.  Gurvitz did not get this man\\'s name, but their\\nconversation was in Hebrew so Gurvitz felt confident the man was\\nactually an Israeli Consulate official.\"\\n\\nAmong the 12,000 names of private citizens that police found in ADL\\nfiles in San Francisco was Mohammed Jarad, a 36-year-old Chicago\\nresident who was arrested in Israel on January 25, for allegedly\\ndistributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hamas, the large\\nIslamic fundamentalist movement in the Occupied Territories.  The\\nChicago ADL office runs at least three undercover informants who work\\nwith \"official friends\" in local law enforcement, according to\\ndocuments released by the San Francisco D.A. and sources close to the\\nADL.  Given these facts, Arab American groups surmise that the ADL has\\npassed information on Jarad to Israeli intelligence.\\n\\nOne technique used by the ADL to monitor the large Arab American\\ncommunity in the Midwest was to scan the local Arab press for funeral\\nnotices.  According to sources familiar with the practice, ADL\\ninvestigators in unmarked vans videotaped the Palestinian funerals,\\nwhich sometimes turned into PLO rallies.  Palestinians have been\\ndetained at Ben-Gurion Airport simply on the basis of having been\\nfilmed attending a funeral in Chicago, according to Suhail Miari, the\\nexecutive director of the United Holy Land Fund, whose cousin was an\\nArab member of Israel\\'s Knesset.\\n\\nShortly after Jarad was arrested, the Israeli government announced\\nthat Hamas was being run from America with money and operational\\ninstructions relayed by courier or fax.  Israel\\'s charges were played\\nup on the front page of _The New York Times_.  According to well-\\nplaced sources, Yehudit Barsky, an ADL fact finder in New York, worked\\nclosely with Israeli officials on this campaign of vilification,\\nintroducing \"friendly\" reporters to \"official friends\" in Chicago law\\nenforcement.\\n\\nBarsky, who is fluent in Arabic, prepared an ADL report about how\\nHamas is funded in America.  She identified the Dallas-based Islamic\\nassociation for Palestine in North America as the front organization\\nfor Hamas in the U.S.A.  \"Its infrastructure functions as an\\ninterlocking network of organizations, small businesses, and\\nindividual activists,\" says the February 1993 ADL report, which\\noutlines the organization\\'s development, its activities on U.S.\\ncollege campuses, and its \"metamorphosis\" during the Gulf War. It\\nalso traces Hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front-\\ngroups from Plainfield, Indiana, to Culver City, California.  It is\\ndoubtful that Barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data\\nwithout the help of \"official friends\" and ADL spies.\\n\\nBarsky refused to comment.  But she used to talk to Greg Slabodkin as\\nmany as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for\\nAIPAC, whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the _Voice_.\\n\"The level of cooperation was very close,\" Slabodkin said during a\\nrecent phone conservation from Israel where he is in graduate school.\\n\"If we felt our files were lacking, we contacted the ADL.\"\\n\\nWhen Sha\\'wan Jabarin, a 30-year-old Palestinian human rights worker in\\nthe Occupied Territories won a $25,000 Reebok Human Rights Award in\\n1990, Slabodkin recalls that Barsky faxed AIPAC the man\\'s entire\\npolice file, which she had obtained from the Israeli embassy.  Jabarin\\nhad been arrested numerous times in Israel, and once confessed to\\nbeing a member of the PLO after having been severely tortured.\\nJabarin, who received a short jail term, became an Amnesty\\nInternational Prisoner of Conscience.  Of course, to AIPAC and the\\nADL, Jabarin was a terrorist.  Slabodkin, who was ordered to keep tabs\\non him when he was in the U.S. to receive his award, called a\\nrepresentative of Al Haq, the Palestinian human rights group that\\nemployed Jabarin, to obtain his itinerary.  AIPAC even opened a file\\non musician Jackson Browne, who presented Jabarin with the Reebok\\naward.\\n\\nWhile the ADL may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of\\nArabs, and even left-wing gay revolutionaries, it has a far harder\\ntime explaining its obsession with spying on anti-apartheid activists.\\nDavid Gurvitz told the FBI that when he started working as a fact\\nfinder for the ADL in L.A. in March 1989, ADL files already bulged\\nwith information about the Israel-South African connection and anti-\\napartheid groups.  \"Gurvitz confirmed that the ADL did routinely\\ncollect information on persons engaged in anti-apartheid activities in\\nthe United States,\" says the FBI report.  While Gurvitz said there\\nwere files in the L.A. ADL office dating to the 1930s, he estimated\\nthe oldest material on anti-apartheid activities dates back to the\\nlate 1970s, paralleling Begin\\'s rise to power in Israel and a\\ndeepening of ties between the Jewish state and South Africa. \"In\\nabout August, 1992,\" says the report of the FBI\\'s March 3, 1993,\\ninterview with Gurvitz, \"an anti-apartheid demonstration was held at\\nthe South African Consulate in Los Angeles.  Participating in the\\ndemonstration were the Los Angeles Student Coalition and the Socialist\\nWorkers Party.  Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions,\\nand a subsequent demonstration.  He wrote a report for the ADL on each\\nof the planning sessions and on the demonstration.  Copies of the\\nreports were disseminated to Bullock, among others, in care of the San\\nFrancisco ADL office.\"\\n\\nIn 1986 Bullock learned that the consul general of the South African\\nConsulate in Los Angeles would be speaking in Las Vegas at a meeting\\norganized by Willis Carto, the head of the anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby.\\n\"Suspecting that the Consul General did not know who Willis Carto is,\"\\nsays the FBI report, \"Bullock suggested to Gerard that they might want\\nto warn the South Africans.  Gerard agreed and informed the Consul\\nGeneral, who canceled his appearance.\"\\n\\nA few months later, Gerard phoned Bullock and told him a South African\\nintelligence officer wanted to meet them.  During a rendezvous in a\\nhotel near Fisherman\\'s Wharf, the South African said he was interested\\nin acquiring information on American anti-apartheid activists.  The\\nSouth African, who called himself Mr. Humphries, also asked for\\ninformation about groups that were advocating divestments.  \"Gerard,\\nwho was present throughout the meeting,\" says the FBI report, \"told\\nHumphries that he [Gerard] had been employed by the CIA....Humphries\\noffered to pay Bullock $150.00 per month in exchange for information.\\nBullock noted that much of the information Humphries said he wanted\\nwas already in the possession of Bullock and the ADL.\"\\n\\nBetween 1987 and 1991, Bullock sold information to South African\\nintelligence, receiving steady raises, which he split evenly with\\nGerard.  \"Bullock said it was his impression, though Gerard never\\nexplicitly told him so, (and Bullock never asked) that Gerard may have\\nbeen telling the CIA about his and Bullock\\'s contacts with the South\\nAfricans,\" says the FBI report.  \"Gerard had said he knew the CIA\\n\\'resident agent\\' in San Francisco....Once, after Gerard dropped\\nBullock off at Bullock\\'s residence following a meeting with Louie [who\\nreplaced Humphries as their handler], Gerard said he was going to go\\nto the San Francisco CIA office.\"\\n\\nAl the while, Gerard may have been \"tasking\" Bullock for the CIA.\\n\"Bullock recalled that once, after he had met Gerard, Bullock went to\\nChicago, Illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the ADL,\"\\nsays the FBI report.  \"The target of the investigation was a group\\ncalled the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.  Bullock learned that a\\nwoman [name deleted] was transporting money between the PLO or the\\nPFLP, and the United States.  Bullock told this to Gerard.  Gerard\\nlater told Bullock that Gerard\\'s \\'guy at the CIA\\' would like to know\\nmore.  Gerard asked Bullock if Bullock would go back to Chicago to\\ngather more information on the Palestine Human Rights Campaign.\\nBullock, however, never did go back.\"\\n\\nGerard also seems to have had a close relationship with Mossad, which\\nmay have started in 1991 when he went on an ADL junket to Israel.  The\\nADL frequently sponsors trips for American law enforcement officials\\nto Israel, where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts\\nin various intelligence agencies.  According to an affidavit by San\\nFrancisco police inspector Roth, the \"all-expense paid trip [to\\nIsrael] was more or less a thank-you gift and a liaison gesture by the\\nADL to continue the close relationships it has with specific law\\nenforcement officers from the United States.\"\\n\\nGerard may have liked what he saw in Israel.  A short time after\\ntravelling there, he went to Addis Ababa where he helped with Mossad\\'s\\nrescue of Ethiopian Jews.\\n\\nAs Gerard\\'s relationship with South Africa deepened, he talked more\\nopenly about his exploits in the CIA.  \"Bullock recalled Gerard\\nmentioning that he had been in Algeria on CIA business, and that\\nGerard discussed the PLO and \\'safehouses,\\'\" says the FBI report, \"To\\nthis Louie once responded that Israeli intelligence had determined\\nthat the PLO and the African National Congress were cooperating.\\nGerard also spoke of having travelled with the CIA to Afghanistan....\\nLouie also [told Gerard and Bullock] about his adventures inside South\\nAfrica as an intelligence officer.  Both Gerard and Louie traded \\'war\\nstories\\' and regaled each other and Bullock with tales of \\'narrow\\nscrapes.\\'\"\\n\\nAlthough there is still much mystery about what triggered law\\nenforcement\\'s investigation of the ADL, it was probably the theft of\\na classified FBI report on the Nation of Islam from the FBI\\'s San\\nFrancisco office.  Police armed with search warrants recovered the\\nreport in the ADL San Francisco office.  Gurvitz says he had sent a\\ncopy of it to Mira Boland, the director of the ADL\\'s fact finding\\ndivision in Washington, D.C.  Boland was preparing an op-ed piece for\\n_The Washington Times_, in which she argued that the Nation of Islam\\nshould not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of L.A.\\nbecause the group is anti-Semitic and violence-prone.  (Boland, who\\nhad arranged the ADL police junket to Israel attended by Gerard,\\ntestified in a 1990 criminal trial in Roanoke, Virginia, that she had\\nworked for the CIA for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for the\\nDefense Department before joining the ADL.  During the trial, Boland\\nadmitted to sharing information with a CIA official at an invitation-\\nonly ADL conference.)\\n\\nAfter he was questioned by the FBI last fall, Gerard fled to the\\nPhilippines, which has no extradition treaty with America.  Gerard is\\nbelieved to have supplied information from police computers not only\\nto the ADL, but to Israel and South Africa as well.  The _San\\nFrancisco Examiner_ reported that Gerard may be charged with violating\\nfederal espionage laws.\\n\\nAlthough Bullock worked for the ADL for 30 years, and Irwin Suall\\npraised him in a July 1992 memo as \"our number one investigator,\" the\\nADL now argues that he was a rogue agent.  In its own defense, the ADL\\nalso asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than\\njournalists.  After all, ask ADL officials, don\\'t journalists keep\\nfiles?\\n\\nBut the difference between the practice of journalism and the ADL\\'s\\nmethod of gathering information couldn\\'t be more striking.\\nJournalists place information in the public domain where they are held\\naccountable for falsehoods, distortions, and libel.  And for the most\\npart, journalists don\\'t share their investigative files with foreign\\nand domestic police agencies.  The ADL has no such inhibition.\\nBecause many of its files are not open to public scrutiny, false\\ninformation collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be\\ncorrected.  Once a proud human rights group, the ADL has become the\\nJewish thought police.\\n\\n\"The ADL says it\\'s a human rights group not just for Jews but for\\neveryone,\" says Chip Berlet, a highly respected researcher at the\\nMassachusetts-based Political Research Associates, which monitors\\nright-wing extremist groups.  \"That\\'s fine but it can\\'t do that and\\nspy on Palestinians.  It\\'s blatantly unethical and frankly immoral.\"\\n\\n\"My argument to people is that the ADL wears four hats.  Each of the\\nhats independently is appropriate.  It is a broad-based human rights\\ngroup that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination.\\nIt is a group that defends Jews against defamation.  Entirely noble.\\nNothing wrong with that hat.  It is a group, whose leaders, at least,\\nconsistently defend the actions of Israel against its critics, which\\nagain is entirely appropriate.  And it is a group that maintains an\\ninformation-sharing arrangement with law enforcement.  Again, there is\\nnothing wrong for a group to do that.\"\\n\\n\"But you can\\'t do all four.  It is impossible to do all four and not\\nviolate the bounds of ethics.  There\\'s a built-in conflict of interest\\nif you wear all four hats.\"\\n\\nADL national director Abraham Foxman apparently sees no such conflict.\\nIn a September 1, 1992, letter to the _Voice_, Foxman complained: \"ADL\\nhas a proud 80-year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil\\nrights and constitutional freedoms.  Any imputation of an effort or\\nmotive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is\\nfalse and baseless\"\\n\\n\"Throughout his pieces [on AIPAC\\'s spying], Friedman describes the\\ndissemination of information as if it were slander, and the existence\\nof files as a token of McCarthyite inclination.  The depiction is\\nmisleading in several ways.  Virtually every journalist, academic,\\npolitician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem\\nrelevant; tracing the logic of Friedman\\'s reckless charges, the\\nLibrary of Congress is tantamount to the KGB.  Moreover, disseminating\\nthe public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor\\nMcCarthyism.\"\\n\\nBut many believe the ADL is increasingly in the defamation business.\\nAsk Jesse Jackson, James Abourezk, or the leaders of the New Jewish\\nAgenda -- all past targets of ADL smears.  (At the same time, the ADL\\nexonerated the fascist World Anti-Communist League, which assisted\\nRonald Reagan\\'s covert war against Nicaragua, a policy endorsed by ADL\\nleaders.)\\n\\nIn the early 1980s, researchers Russ Bellant and Berlet asked to meet\\nfact finding head Irwin Suall, to discuss their work on anti-Semite\\nLyndon LaRouche.  \"Our view then of Irwin Suall was that he was this\\nreally terrific investigator,\" says Berlet.  \"So we introduce\\nourselves, say what we are up to and Suall leans back in his chair and\\nbasically runs down a dossier on each of us: about what our political\\nactivities are, who we work with, what organizations we belong to.\\nObviously, he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds\\nadmirably.  We were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling\\nvery uncomfortable.\"\\n\\n\"And then he leans forward and says, \\'The right-wing isn\\'t the\\nproblem.  The left-wing is the problem.  The Soviet Union is the\\nbiggest problem in the world for Jews.  It\\'s the American left that is\\nthe biggest threat to American Jews.  You\\'re on the wrong track.\\nYou\\'re part of the problem.\\'  We were stunned.  I was virtually in\\ntears.  This is not how I perceived myself.  We basically stumbled out\\nof there in a daze.\"\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n               Letters (response to Friedman\\'s article)\\n\\n         The Village Voice, May 18, 1993, Vol. XXXVIII No. 20\\n\\nA LEAGUE OF HIS OWN\\n\\nRobert I. Friedman\\'s assault on the Anti-Defamation League [The Anti-\\nDefamation League Is Spying On You.\" May 11] demonstrates that he has\\nan axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote.\\nIt also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down\\non his list.  The story is replete with inaccuracies, innuendos, and\\noutright falsehoods, and conveys a picture of ADL so divorced from\\nreality as to be farcical.  Friedman is even wrong on such basic,\\neasily determined facts as where ADL was founded (Chicago, not New\\nYork) and the building in which ADL\\'S San Francisco office is located\\n(not the Jewish Community Federation building pictured).\\n\\nADL has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years, without\\n\"spying\" on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for\\nthe law.  Our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti-\\nJewish, racist, anti-democratic, and violence-prone, and we monitor\\nthem primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings.\\nThrough the years, we have published scores of reports on anti-\\nSemitism emanating from both the left and the right.  In fact,\\nalthough Friedman\\'s bias leads him to assume the contrary, ADL\\'s\\nprimary concern is still the far right.\\n\\nBecause extremist organizations are highly secretive, sometimes ADL\\ncan learn of their activities only by using undercover sources.\\nFriedman\\'s hyperbole notwithstanding, these sources function in a\\nmanner directly analogous to investigative journalists.  Some have\\nperformed great service to the American people -- for example, by\\nuncovering the existence of right-wing extremist paramilitary training\\ncamps -- with no recognition and at considerable personal risk.  The\\ninformation ADL obtains is placed in the public domain, and through\\nthe years ADL has established a reputation for accurate reporting.\\n\\nFriedman\\'s article, by contrast, contains so much misinformation that\\nit would take an article equally as long to set the record straight.\\nA few examples:  He states that an \"ADL leader was deeply involved in\\nthe [Jonathan Pollard] Israeli spy operation,\" and that Pollard\\'s\\nhandler\\'s wife \"worked for the New York ADL as a lawyer.\"  Not true.\\nFriedman also states:  \"ADL investigators in unmarked vans videotaped\\nPalestinian funerals.\"  Not true.  Elsewhere, he asserts that ADL was\\nobsessed \"with spying on anti-apartheid activists.\"  Again, not true.\\nWe could go on and on -- and, of course, Friedman does not reveal\\n*his* sources.\\n\\nThe distortion games Friedman plays when he mentions numbers further\\nreveal his lack of objectivity.  When it comes to how much ADL paid\\nRoy Bullock a week -- as an independent contractor, not an employee\\n(an important distinction Friedman also fails to make) -- he includes\\nthe zeros ($75.00, $150.00), inviting the reader to see a large\\nnumber.  By contrast, when he observes that ADL paid Bullock \"nearly\\n$170,000\" between 1985 and 1993, he chooses not to point out that\\namounts to little more than $20,000 a year -- hardly an excessive sum.\\n\\nWhat is accurate about Friedman\\'s story is Chip Berlet\\'s description\\nof ADL\\'s four hats.  Yes, ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice and\\ndiscrimination.  Yes, ADL defends Israel against critics.  And yes,\\nADL maintains an information-sharing relationship with law enforcement\\nregarding extremist activities and hate crimes.  We see no conflict in\\nthese four activities, and we believe most _Voice_ readers won\\'t\\neither.\\n\\nABRAHAM FOXMAN\\nNational Director\\nAnti-Defamation League\\nManhattan\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nROBERT I. FRIEDMAN REPLIES:\\n\\nFor the ADL to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd.\\nJournalists don\\'t spy on Arabs and anti-apartheid activists and then\\nfreely pass their files to South African and Israeli intelligence.\\nBut according to police the confessions of two paid ADL investigators,\\nbuttressed by 700 pages of court documents and interviews, the ADL\\ndoes.  Indeed, the ADL spies on groups that are neither anti-Semitic\\nnor violent.  Police confiscated ADL files on hundreds of mainstream\\ngroups ranging from ACT UP to Peace Now.  Respected intellectuals and\\nMiddle East scholars who disagree with the ADL\\'s political views have\\nended up on ADL blacklists, their reputations smeared.  \"Private\\norganizations have no business paying operatives inside police\\ndepartments or having spies,\" says an April 17 editorial in the _St.\\nLouis Post-Dispatch_, condemning ADL spying.  On April 10, police\\narmed with search warrants raided ADL offices in San Francisco and\\nL.A. after concluding that \"ADL employees were apparently less than\\ntruthful\" in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier\\nsearch, according to San Francisco police inspector Ron Roth\\'s sworn\\naffidavit.  Roth also asserts that Bullock was a \"paid employee for\\nthe ADL.\"  If so, by failing to pay taxes on $170,000 of income paid\\nto Bullock, the ADL could face a total of 48 felony counts, according\\nto court papers.  The ADL may also face felony charges for illegally\\nobtaining confidential information from police computers.  As for\\nerrors:  The ADL was founded in Chicago, and moved to New York in\\n1947.  But it was an original tenant in the San Francisco building\\nshown in the _Voice_ photo, moving out a few months ago.  I never\\nwrote that an \"ADL leader was deeply involved in the [Pollard]\\nIsraeli spy operation.\"  I reported that Pollard himself made the\\ncharge.  And in court papers, Pollard\\'s own lawyer said that the wife\\nof Pollard\\'s handler worked for the ADL.  If I have a bias, it is on\\nthe side of the First and Fourth Amendments.\\n\\n'),\n",

So far, Israe \\ncontinues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they \\nleave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that \\nthe only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a\\nreduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....\\nand in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTim: \\n\\nThere seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The\\nfirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so\\nthere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in \\nexchange for pieces of paper, \"expectations\", \"hopes\", etc. The second\\nis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that\\nthese \"tangible concessions\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving\\nanything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances\\nseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns\\nfor its expected concessions. By \"tangible\" is meant something that\\n1) provides Israel with \"comparable\" protection (from the land it is to \\ngive up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine \\n**will be** accountable and held actively (not just \"diplomatically) \\nresponsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens \\nor \"visitors\").\\n\\nIn essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian\\nstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel\\nwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** \\nco-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel \\nfrom its territory.\\n\\tAside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,\\n\\thow *could* such \"guarantees\" be instilled? For example,\\n\\thow could such \"guarantees\"/\"controls\" be added to the\\n\\tPalestinian PISGA proposals?\\n\\nIsrael is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute\\nit lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more \"buffer zone\", gives\\nfull autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties\\ncould (and *would*, if not \"controlled\" somehow) EASILY return to the \\ntraditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really*\\nensure that that will not happen.\\n\\nTim\\n\\n'),\n",

Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments\\nmade by people on this subject:\\n\\n(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims\\n    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.\\n\\n(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel\\n    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.\\n\\nIn 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,\\nand (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if\\nBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\\nTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\\nclue what was their ancestor\\'s actual nationality.  In fact, although\\nBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national\\nallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and\\nhistoric identity.  So, arguments like \"yes, but your ancestors were\\nCroats or Serbs\" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what\\ntheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel\\nthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.\\nWhat outsiders say is simply not relevant.\\n\\n>the way the western press use the word \\'muslim\\' in this Bosnian debacle has \\n>kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was \\n>changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended!\\n\\nIn the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when \"Muslim nationality\"\\nappeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result\\nof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing\\n\"Bosniaks\" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)\\ndeclaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement \\nof this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of\\n\"Muslim nationality\" choice in census forms.\\n\\nFor comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories\\navailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:\\n\\nSerb-Muslims:                        71,991\\nCroat-Muslims:                       25,295\\nMuslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403\\n\\nThis clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own\\nnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat\\nnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have\\nconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose \"undeclared\",\\nin 1953 they chose \"Yugoslavs\", in 1961 both \"Yugoslavs\" and \"Bosniak \\nethnic group\", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose \"Muslim nationality\".\\n\\nPerhaps the term \"Bosnian Muslim nationality\" is too confusing for\\nthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking\\nabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some\\nseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and\\ncultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,\\nbecause the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political\\nfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival\\ndominate people\\'s thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,\\nBosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime\\nas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n-Josip\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of\\nterrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the\\nArabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\\nsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\\nfavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they\\nmassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing\\nto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their\\nvery lives.\\n\\tI mention this not because I\\'m anti semitic [I\\'m part\\nJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the\\nIsraelites pisses me off so.

This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \\nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today\\'s Turkish\\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \\nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \\nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \\nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \\npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \\ncrime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the \\nsuccessful genocide of the Armenians.\\n\\nTurkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...\\nArmenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of \\nTurkey!

The following letter, which represents a small portion \\nof the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical \\ndocuments, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, \\nwas sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, \\nprogram directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and \\nradio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide \\nof 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people \\nof Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the \\nlost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is \\nmourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their \\nlives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations \\nmay live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and \\nprosperously.\\n\\n------------------------- letter ----------------------------------\\n\\nDuring the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nhas planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which \\nnot only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the \\nmethod used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, \\nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \\nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \\nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\\n\\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \\nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \\nGenocide.\\n\\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \\nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\\n\\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\\n\\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\\n\\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \\nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \\nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \\nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \\nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \\ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \\nof the Turkish Genocide.\\n\\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \\ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\\n\\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \\nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \\nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \\nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\\n\\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \\nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \\n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \\ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \\narmed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon\\nall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in \\nthe political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary\\nof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.'

To this day, \\nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \\nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \\nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\\n\\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \\nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \\nGenocide.\\n\\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \\nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\\n\\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\\n\\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\\n\\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \\nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \\nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \\nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \\nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \\ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \\nof the Turkish Genocide.\\n\\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \\ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\\n\\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \\nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \\nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \\nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\\n\\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \\nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \\n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \\ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \\narmed struggle.

Dec. 1989\\n\\nLeading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,\\nlaunched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth\\nCouncil meeting in North London, last week.\\n\\nThe diaspora, he claimed, \"was the cancer connected to the main\\ntissue of the Jewish people\". He was scathing about its failure to\\nact before the Holocaust.\\n\\nHe said the diaspora\\'s religious and secular leadership had\\nignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed\\nZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \"the failure\\nof Judaism\".\\n\\nHis talk, entitled \"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\", covered 5,000\\nyears of Jewish history.\\n\\nMr. Yehoshua\\'s other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he\\nsaid \"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\", and all Jews\\noutside Israel \"who were using other people\\'s countries like\\nhotels\".\\n\\nThe only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was\\nimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived\\nelsewhere.\\n\\nWorse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her\\ncitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.\\n\\nMr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \"a soldier for aliyah\",\\nended by calling for the creation of a new \"total Jew\", living in\\nIsrael.\\n\\nEarlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the\\ndifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,\\nMr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the\\ncountry\\'s political situation.\\n\\nHe said Israel\\'s wars had once provided writers with a vital\\nsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing\\ndirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been\\nproduced about the intifada.\\n\\nInstead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,\\nemigration from Israel and personal and family issues.\\n\\nMr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the\\nIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into an\\nIsraeli Arab\\'s shoes and portray him as a real \"flesh and blood\\ncharacter\".\\n\\nHe claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of\\nIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too\\npre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,\\nand were not concerned with the nature of that identity.\\n\\nJewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,\\nunlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the\\ncountry they lived in, he said.\\n\\nHe warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish\\npeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially in\\nliterary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English\\nlanguage.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

I moved there from\\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\\nArutunian, my husband\\'s name . . .\\n\\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \\nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \\nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \\nyear. I couldn\\'t find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \\nI, I\\'ll just say it, couldn\\'t steal, couldn\\'t deceive, and couldn\\'t be \\ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \\ntold me, \"Leave, don\\'t keep the others from working, you aren\\'t cut out for \\nthis kind of work.\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \\nthe Armenians, like \"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\\nthey\\'ve multiplied here they\\'re making it hard for us to live,\" and \"Things \\nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\" \"No problem, the Turks will \\nhelp,\" they say, \"if we ask them, they\\'ll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \\nhour.\" Well that\\'s the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \\nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn\\'t imagine it. \\nHere we\\'ve been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \\neven considered such an idea possible.\\n\\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \\npeople I would often ask, \"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \\nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what\\'s going\\non?\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \\neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \\nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn\\'t be saying this now if I \\nhadn\\'t received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \\nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \\nThe women told me, \"There he is, there he is, that\\'s Muslimzade.\" I didn\\'t \\nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \\nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \"Are you the First \\nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\" He answers me, \"Yes.\" And I ask him, \\n\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \\nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don\\'t know \\nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\\nme, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\\nanother question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \\nus? And he said, \"I. . . We didn\\'t know what to do, we didn\\'t know, we didn\\'t \\nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\"\\n\\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \\nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \"No, we actually didn\\'t \\nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \\nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\" Those are his \\nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\\nArmenian SSR.\\n\\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it\\'s painful to discuss them, \\nbecause it may seem that it\\'s not true to someone else. Various rumors \\nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren\\'t. \\nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \\nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\\nprogress, I don\\'t know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\\nor around Moscow, I wouldn\\'t have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \\na genocide, it was a massacre. That\\'s genuinely what it was.\\n\\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn\\'t know about the 27th because my \\nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \\nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You\\'re in bed? You don\\'t \\nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \\nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \\nand asking, \\'Are you an Armenian?\\' If they answered in Armenian, then they \\nturned the car over and burned it.\" This isn\\'t made up, the wife of the Senior\\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \\nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she\\'s my \\nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \\nmiddle of it, I don\\'t know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \\nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn\\'t even believe it, and \\nI said, \"Certainly that didn\\'t happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \\n\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \\nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don\\'t break \\nthe shop windows, don\\'t destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\\n\" I didn\\'t hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \\nalthough he\\'s an Azerbaijani.\\n\\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\\nis the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there\\'s a crowd out \\nthere.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \\nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \\nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I\\'m sorry, I \\ndon\\'t know the building number or the people\\'s names, since we were in my \\nhusband\\'s apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \\nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \\nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \\nwasn\\'t enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn\\'t finished\\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \\nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \\nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \\ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn\\'t tell \\nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn\\'t \\nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn\\'t dared to stick up for the \\nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\\n\\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \\nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \\noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \\nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \\nfirst I couldn\\'t figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \\n\"Lendrush, l think they\\'re beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \\ndon\\'t know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \\nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \\nhe didn\\'t see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \\nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \\ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \\nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \\nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that\\'s a good block and a half or two \\nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\\n\\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\\n\\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \\nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it\\'s true, \\ndefended us, they said, \"There aren\\'t any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \\nonly Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\\n\\nBut at two o\\'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \\ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he\\'s \\nupset about something, but I can\\'t. I was standing, running from balcony to \\nbalcony. Our power was out, I don\\'t remember for how long, but it was as \\nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \\nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \\nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \\ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \\nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \\nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \\ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\\ngarbage out at two o\\'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \\ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \\ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \\nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \\nthey answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \\nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don\\'t \\nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \\ntalking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \\nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \\nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\\n\\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \\nI don\\'t know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \\nreally didn\\'t know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \\nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \\nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \\nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \\nand was getting ready to give his daughter\\'s hand in marriage, but, alas,\\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \\nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \\nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \\nhadn\\'t already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \\nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \\nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \\nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \\napartments. Something on the order of \"We\\'ll move the Armenians out and take \\nover their apartments.\"\\n\\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \\ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \\nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \\nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \\nSumgait that there wasn\\'t anything holy about them, that Party membership was \\nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \\nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \\nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\\n\\nI can\\'t talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \\nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \\nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \\nthe situation the way it was. And what\\'s interesting is that when we left on \\nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \\npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \\nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \\nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \\nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \\nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn\\'t want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \\nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \\ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn\\'t have people at hand to whom\\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \\nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let\\'s protect our \\nneighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren\\'t such that there was no \\ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn\\'t have firearms, \\nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \\nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \\nnoticed them: there aren\\'t rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \\nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \\nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \\nus, why wasn\\'t it arranged? It means that the government didn\\'t want to do \\nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \\nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won\\'t mention the things \\nI didn\\'t see myself, I\\'ll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \\nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o\\'clock in the evening, when I saw them\\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \\no\\'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\\nhadn\\'t completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \\nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \\npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \\ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \\nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \\nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \\nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \\nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \\nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can\\'t remember the name of it, where there\\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I\\'m upset and\\nI can\\'t think of the name . . . there\\'s a tall building there, a 9-story, and \\nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \\nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \\nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \\nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \\nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \\nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \\nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \\ninvolved.\\n\\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\\ntruth, I\\'ve been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \\nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \\nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I\\'m an adventure seeker, and\\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \\nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\\nor the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I\\'ll get you \\nout of here; If I want to, I\\'ll get rid of you; If I want to, I\\'ll do \\nsomething else? And there\\'s a black market price for everything, in the most \\nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor\\'s pool, he had \\nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won\\'t even believe this, but this, I\\'m afraid,\\nI heard with my own ears: \"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\\nthat you know will never have any effect? You\\'re alone against everyone, so \\ninstead why don\\'t you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \\nwill go fine for you.\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \\ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \\nit, I still have a copy, but what\\'s the use? When the General Procuracy got \\ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \\nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \\nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don\\'t know \\nif they\\'re going to pursue it or not. Because, you\\'ll excuse me, I no longer \\nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It\\'s all \\ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \\nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that\\'s nonsense, that\\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \\nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\\n\\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don\\'t know, at the time I was in such a\\nstate that I didn\\'t even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\\nOf course, it\\'s not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\\nVitaly [Danielian], I don\\'t know his last name, goes to school with him, or\\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there\\'s one important detail:\\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren\\'t working in \\nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \\nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\\nliked They weren\\'t afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \\ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\\n\\nNow I\\'m going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \\nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\\nhis mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik\\'s, what if they kill\\nhim? Maybe he\\'s still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\\n. . . He\\'s a nice guy, we all like him, he\\'s a good person, he\\'s smart.\" His \\nmother wouldn\\'t let him go. In tears, she says, \"Valery, you can\\'t go because \\nI am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We\\'ll just watch, \\njust have a look.\" They made it through. I don\\'t know, I think Vitalik\\'s\\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \\nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \\neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \\napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \\nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \\nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \\nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \\nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn\\'t even know they were dead. So two weeks \\nago, I don\\'t know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \\nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \\nYerevan. So it\\'s been about a month already; it\\'s so hard to keep all this \\nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik\\'s family has\\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn\\'t admit \\nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \\na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \\nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \\nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\\n\\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \\nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \\nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\\n\\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \\nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \\nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I\\'m not lying, \\nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \\nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \\nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \\nI don\\'t know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\\n\\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\\npoint when I couldn\\'t even go outside because if you went outside you saw\\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\\n\\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\\nwith bulldozers. I didn\\'t know whether to believe it or not. And people who \\ndon\\'t know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \\nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \\nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \\nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \\nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \\nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn\\'t attack \\nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don\\'t\\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \\nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \\nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \\nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \\npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \\nArmenian?\"\\n\\nOf course I\\'m upset, but it\\'s utterly impossible to discuss such things and\\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \\ncouldn\\'t believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \\ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \\nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \\ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\\nalready sick. It\\'s true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \\ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \\nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \\nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \\nwere never given any direct orders, they didn\\'t know what they were authorized\\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o\\'clock in the evening\\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \\nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \\npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \\nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \\ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\\nhand and said, \"Citizen, don\\'t worry, we\\'ll go and have a talk in my office.\\nI told him, \"No, after everything you\\'ve done, I don\\'t believe one iota of \\nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I\\'ll disappear, and the \\ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can\\'t stand it when . . . \" Oh \\nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \\nvery funny, although at the time I wasn\\'t up to laughing. He was in a nice, \\nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \\ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\\nyou\\'re in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\\nthem?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don\\'t know who \\nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade\\'s head \\nand hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We\\'re not marauders. We\\'re not you! We \\ndidn\\'t come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \\nMuslimzade says to me, \"But I\\'m not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I\\'m not\\nguilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you\\'re not guilty, have it your way. But give \\nus an answer, we\\'re asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \\nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \\ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \\nthen?\" \"You know, we didn\\'t expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn\\'t \\nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \\nlaughing and said, \"It\\'s truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn\\'t \\nknow what to do.\" And I say, \"I\\'m sorry, but it\\'ll be ridiculous if I tell \\nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn\\'t march out in \\nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \\nover his dead body. That\\'s what you should have done. That\\'s the way it was \\nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \\naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \\nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \\nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \\nThat\\'s right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \\nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \\nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \\nimpunity. And if it weren\\'t for the troops it wouldn\\'t have been just two \\ndays, there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \\nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \\nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \\nthem, \\'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we\\'ll come after you, too.\"\\n\\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \\nasked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \\nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We\\'ll finish that quickly. You\\'ll\\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we\\'ll decide later.\" The \\nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \\ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \\nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\\nas everyone knows, he\\'s the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \\nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \\nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn\\'t not say it, \\nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \\nand he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it\\'s\\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \\npunished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that\\'s a quote. Then one mother \\nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\\n\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \\nto calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \\ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \\nmust help us, because we don\\'t know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \\nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \\nsomeone saw something. Don\\'t be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \\nyou\\'re not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \\nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \\nabout, let\\'s say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \\nlater. We\\'re going to do it like this: We\\'re going to set up an urn and you \\ncan throw what you write in there. We don\\'t need to know who wrote it. The \\nnames of the people who write won\\'t be made public, but we need all the\\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \\nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \\ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \\nthe information into the urn.\"\\n\\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \\npeople who didn\\'t even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \\ncame up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won\\'t happen to you as \\nwill happen to me. So please . . . I\\'ll give you the information, and you \\nplease write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don\\'t know if \\nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \\ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can\\'t lie, thousands simply \\ncan\\'t lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \\nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\\n\\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \\nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \\none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \\nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \\nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \\npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \\nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \"Where were\\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you\\'re trying to convince us to \\nreturn, why didn\\'t you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \\nit was all leading?\" he says, \"You\\'re telling the truth. Let\\'s not mince \\nwords. You\\'ve told me right to my face, and I\\'ll tell you straight. I\\'ll tell \\nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \\ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \\n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \\nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\"\\nI say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \\nit?\" And he says, \"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \\nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \" I say, \"Fine, \\nyou didn\\'t know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \\nknown. Why did no one help us?\" And he says, \"Well, OK, we didn\\'t know what to\\ndo\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \\nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \\nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \\nAzerbaijanis . . . \" To this l answered, \"You know what . . . I\\'m speaking \\nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \\nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \\nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \" I asked him, \"What would you say about this\\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\" Then he said, \"Yes, I \\nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \\nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \\nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \\nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\"\\nAnd I say, \"There\\'s nothing to add to what really happened. I don\\'t think it\\'s\\npossible to add anything more awful.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree with you, I \\nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\" I repeat that he\\nsaid \"unfortunate occurrence.\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \\nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\\nand said, \"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \" I take this to mean that \\nhe really thinks it\\'s an \"unfortunate occurrence.\" \"And of course,\" he says, \\n\"I understand that having gone through all this you can\\'t return to Sumgait, \\nbut it\\'s necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \\ntried.\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don\\'t know if it matters or not, \\nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \\naffair.\\n\\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \\nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \"What, they didn\\'t\\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\" I was floored, I hadn\\'t imagined that\\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \\nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"I don\\'t know, \\nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors\\' pool. Be grateful if they don\\'t \\nput it down as unexcused absence.\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \\nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \\nthey\\'re telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \\nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\\nis Rasulov, and he\\'s had that position for many years. Incidentally, he\\'s a \\nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \\nsaid, \"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" He looked at me askance\\nand said, \"And why are you\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\"why did\\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" I say, \"What do you mean, why did I get \\nwrapped up in this mess? My husband\\'s an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \\nArmenian last name.\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \\nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \"I didn\\'t expect that you would\\n. . . \" What did he mean by that? And \"how\" should he behave, the chief of the\\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it\\'s true, there was a \\nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \\nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \\ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\\nHe\\'s going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \\nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\\n\\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I\\'m going back to Mamedov\\'s office when I asked \\nhim \"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \\nto Sumgait?\" he answered, \"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don\\'t\\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \\nwon\\'t guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" I say, \"So you\\'ve got another\\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they\\'ll be quiet and then \\nin another 50 years it\\'ll happen again?!\" I couldn\\'t contain myself any more,\\nand I also told him, \"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \\nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \\neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn\\'t you prepare people for this by the \\nway you treated them?\" And he says, \"You know, you\\'re finally starting to \\ninsult me!\" He threw his pen on the desk. \"Maybe now you\\'ll say I\\'m a \\nscoundrel too?\" I say, \"You know, I\\'m not talking about you because I don\\'t \\nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \\ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\\n\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \\nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \\ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \\n\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \\nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \\nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\\nSumgait.\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, \\'\\n\"Well, I walked down the street.\" And I said, \"Walking down the street in any \\ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\\nbecause I would be a guest, I don\\'t have any contact with people, but if you \\nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn\\'t \\nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you\\'d \\nhear something quite different.\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \\nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \\nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \\nthought maybe that in fact it wasn\\'t something general, of a mass nature, some\\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \\naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \\nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \\npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \\nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \\ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \\nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \\nwithdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of \\ncourse, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .\\n\\n  April 20, 1988\\n  Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

From the outset,\\nthe efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took\\nthe form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty\\nand genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian\\nactivities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of\\nterror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element\\nof brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass\\nrebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,\\nwhen the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis\\ndefeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.\\nAlthough the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they\\nwere constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their\\ncountry in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked\\nin this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum\\nin 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on\\nthe local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]\\n\\nFor example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander\\nof the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan: \\n\\n \"They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down \\n  by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a \\n  building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.\" \\n\\nAs for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:\\n\\n\"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning\\n with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken\\n in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army\\n withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian\\n massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked\\n in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places\\n selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs\\n were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after\\n being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part \\n of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the\\n cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering\\n from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived\\n in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.\\n Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not\\n exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in\\n Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything\\n that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them\\n in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting\\n on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages\\n left behind after their occupation of this area.\"[2]\\n \\nForeign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers\\nwho did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the\\ngenocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.\\nWhat is most important is that they stated in their reports \\'the \\nmassacres did not happen by chance but were planned.\\'[3]\\n\\nAt the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague\\nDr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars,\\nErzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the\\ncruelties.

If a state of non-violence could be \\nmaintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e.,\\ngreater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the\\n\"territories\".  \\n\\nOf course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work\\nalso - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel\\nSharon\\'s mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life,\\ni.e., no winners.\\n\\nSecondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding\\nto \"stiff resistance\" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S.\\ntroops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israelis\\ncould not.\\n\\nJust my $.02 worth, no offense intended.\\n\\nRespectfully,     \\n\\nBen.\\n'),\n",

Can anybody deny these facts?\\n\\nJews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was \\nquite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi \\nrevisionists say!\\n\\n[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in\\n[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)\\n[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \\n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \\n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \\n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \\n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \\n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\\n\\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \\nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \\ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\\naway!\\n\\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\\n[SY] around, people assumed that \\'Armenians killed us, raped our women\\',\\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \\n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \\n\\nI don\\'t follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\\n\\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\\n\\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \\nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \\nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \\nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \\ncaused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years \\nearlier in eastern Anatolia. My father\\'s mother\\'s family escaped Cemiskezek -> \\nErzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> \\nMassachusetts. \\n\\n[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience\\n[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were\\n[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to\\n[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\\n[SY] unattractive! I don\\'t want to go into any graphic detail.\\n\\nMy grandmother\\'s brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\\npotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian\\nyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,\\nlocal Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive \\ntoday.\\n\\n[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.\\n[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But\\n[SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before.

In fact, although\\n\\nI am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been \\nborn from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land, \\nyet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself \\na Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature,\\nnot a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying\\nwith the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by \\nWesterners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat: \\n\\n\"If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the\\nnations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have\\nopposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. \\nThey obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody \"to worship in their own\\nway\" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,\\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \\npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \\nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\\ncountries.\"[1]\\n\\n\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It\\nwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of\\nRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a\\nRomanian nation today\" (Popescu Ciocanel).\\n\\n\"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without\\ninterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy\\nof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most\\nadvanced European countries.\"[2]\\n\\n\"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw\\nis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples\\nof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account\\nof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of\\nsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into\\naction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves\\nhappy!\" (A. de Mortraye).[3]\\n\\n\"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the\\ninquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate\\nvictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that\\nin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and\\nPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been\\nliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,\\nand are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the\\ncruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to\\nappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,\\nhowever, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,\\nlocal courts immediately take them under their protection.\"\\n\\n\"In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are\\nliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and\\nthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is\\nmore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition \\nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \\nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in\\nthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical\\nprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing\\ntheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them\\nwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of \\npriests.\" (A.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to\\neducation, to establish a family and have children, to human\\ndignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are\\nmore important to human existence that the rights of states.\\n\\n2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and\\nrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.\\n\\n3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as\\nJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an\\nunresolved conflict exists.\\n\\n4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of\\npeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples\\nand nations.\\n\\n5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars\\nin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.\\n\\n6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional\\npolitical means have failed.\\n\\n7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two\\ndistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the\\nland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.\\n\\n8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake\\nof peace and justice. When people love, they share.\\n\\nHaving stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\\n\\n1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants\\nfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew\\nand the other Palestinian-Arab.\\n\\n2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove\\nthat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli\\ncitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,\\nalthough born in areas under current Isreali control, is not\\nentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.\\n\\n3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For\\nthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each\\nsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.\\n\\n\\n4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which\\nhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the\\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and\\nChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of\\ngovernments and international organizations.\\n\\n5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'\\nmarriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on\\n'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its\\nethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a\\ntruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of\\npeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into the\\nMiddle-East in a graceful manner.\\n\\nObjections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will\\nattempt to identify some of these:\\n\\n1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected\\nforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,\\nit is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is\\nrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the\\nperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International\\nlaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at\\nreducing racial discrimination and segregation.\\n\\n2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\\nis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is\\na conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous\\ncolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed\\nstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the\\n'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but\\nIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be\\ndefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill\\nthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental\\nhuman rights over collective rights (see above)\\n\\n3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of\\nfinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their\\npoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People\\noverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of\\nhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar\\nBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he\\ngave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing\\nassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its\\neffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit\\neither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see\\nabove)\\n\\n4.      It may objected that only a few people in\\nIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus\\nnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that\\nalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect\\nof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed\\ncouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and\\nencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist\\nattitudes.\\n\\n5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to\\nbring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has\\nmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than\\n$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government\\nand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the\\nMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would\\nsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable\\nclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in\\nIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a\\nnon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.\\n\\nI would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as\\nwell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful\\ndiscussion and enrichment.\\n\\nElias Davidsson Post Box 1760 121 Reykjavik, ICELAND\\n\\n\"),\n",

A genocide of Armenians took place\\nduring peacetime.\\n\\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\\n\\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \\nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \\ndidn\\'t think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\\nwouldn\\'t go into people\\'s apartments. About five o\\'clock we saw a large crowd \\nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \\nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \\nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \\nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \\ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \\nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \\nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn\\'t know \\nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\\n\\nSuddenly there\\'s pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \\nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\\n\\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \\nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What\\'s going on? What\\'s \\nhappened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don\\'t open the door, we \\nsay, \"If we have to leave, we\\'ll leave, we\\'ll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No, \\nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they\\'ve \\nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \\nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \\nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \\naxe, and then with a crowbar.\\n\\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \\nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \\npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \\nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \\nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \\nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\\nwere many of them.\\n\\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \\ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \\nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \\nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \\nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \\nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \\nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \\nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \\nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \\nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \\nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \\none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \\nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \\nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What\\'s with you, \\nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\\nShe says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \\nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \\nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \\n\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \\nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \\ndon\\'t need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \\nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \\nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \\ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don\\'t \\nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \\nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \\ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \\nevening and all through the night.\\n\\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \\nfrom Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \\nhave our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\\nin the room.\\n\\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\\nwe say, if they descend on us again we\\'ll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \\none o\\'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \\ninvestigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we\\'re coming back \\nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \\nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \\nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \\nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \\nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \\nwent up to the neighbor\\'s.\\n\\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \\nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\\n19 and 20, that\\'s next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \\ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \\nweren\\'t at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \\npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \\nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They\\'re up there, still,\\nup there. Let\\'s go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \\nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \\none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \\nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \\nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \\nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that\\'s from some of the \\nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \\nhim down.\\n\\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o\\'clock. They smashed open the door and \\nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\\n\\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \\ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don\\'t you now they\\'re checking all the \\napartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \\nthis apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors\\'. At\\nfirst the man didn\\'t want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o\\'clock at night. We heard the sound\\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \\ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \\nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \\nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \\nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\\n\\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \\nsaved. Our salvation--my mother\\'s, my brother\\'s, and mine,--was purely \\naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \\ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\\nable to save Mother. We couldn\\'t save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \\nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \\nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \\ntroops. And if troops hadn\\'t come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \\neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \\ngenocide.\\n\\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \\nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \\norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to \\'\\npick up Father\\'s corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o\\'clock \\nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \\nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \\nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \\nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \\nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \\nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman\\'s corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \\nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman\\'s body. It \\nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \\nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \\nman there, too, several men. You couldn\\'t tell anything because their faces \\nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\\n\\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \\nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \\nfather, and how we fought, and the people\\'s sorrow, and especially the morgue.\\n\\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \\nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\\n\\nI\\'m particularly surprised that the mob wasn\\'t even afraid of the troops. They\\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \\nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \\nweren\\'t afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \\ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \\ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \\nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \\nweren\\'t afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \\nat the neighbors\\' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \\noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \\nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \\nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \\ncame to anyone\\'s aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\\n\\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \\nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \\nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \\nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\\n\\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country\\'s leadership, and to the\\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \\nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \\nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\\n\\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\\npossible punishment, because if they don\\'t, the tragedy, the genocide, could \\nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\\nout for such deeds.\\n\\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \\ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \\nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that\\'s how many people took \\npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\\n\\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \\nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\\n\\n   May 18, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

The Negev in the Year 2000\\n\\nJust after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase \"the\\nJewish pioneers will make the desert bloom\" was trumpeted\\nthroughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David\\nBen-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: \"It\\'s by our\\npioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land\\ninto a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in\\nabandoned desert areas\".\\n\\nContrary to Ben-Gurion\\'s assertion, it must be affirmed that\\nduring the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for\\ncenturies previous, a productive human presence was to be found in\\nall parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys\\nof the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These\\nwere the Bedouin Arabs.\\n\\nThe real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern\\npart, occurred after Israel\\'s dispossession of the Bedouin\\'s\\ncultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the\\n12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the\\nState of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond\\nrecognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev\\nare the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief\\nrole is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture\\nlands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and\\ndumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli\\nJews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area\\ncultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish\\npastoral activity.\\n\\nI. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin\\nbefore and after 1948\\n-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,\\naccording to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba\\nsub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel\\'s Negev, or\\nSouthern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin\\nArabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep\\nand 22,000 goats.\\n\\nThe majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in\\nthe north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per\\nyear. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the\\nBeersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more\\nthan double the area cultivated by the Negev\\'s Jewish settlers\\nafter 40 years of \"making the desert bloom\"*\\n\\nThe Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of\\nbarley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming\\ntechniques were primitive, but production was based solely on\\nanimal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal\\nproduction, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.\\nProduction increased considerably during the rainy years and\\ndiminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture\\nanimals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight\\nquickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many\\nwaterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the\\nresult of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh\\nlocal conditions.\\n\\nAfter the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev\\nBedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The\\n10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of\\n40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150\\nmm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out\\nof three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,\\nspring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin\\nshepherds from roaming.\\n\\nA few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.\\nBut after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these\\nBedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure\\nwas applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields\\nin order that the land could be transferred to the army.\\n\\nNo reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held\\ntoday by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of\\nthe 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized\\nby the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now\\nconfined to seven \"development towns\", or *sowetos*, established\\nfor them.\\n\\n(the rest of the article is available from Elias Davidsson, email:\\nelias@ismennt.is)\\n\\n'),\n",

We\\nwere able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the\\nPalestinian\\'s popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -\\ncurrently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous\\nstatement: \"You look for me !\", i.e., I\\'am not making any more\\nefforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid\\'s point of view,\\nPalestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew\\nor the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the\\nPalestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly\\nMERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from\\nresidents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his\\ngovernment\\'s and his party\\'s lack of action for human rights and\\npeace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether\\nthey would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists\\'\\nperspective this is the best government because it is THEIR\\ngovernment, regardless of what it does.\\n\\nThese members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the\\nfuture of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to\\ndictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step\\ntowards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin\\'s\\ngovernment, and from their point of view the expulsions were a\\nmarginal byproduct of this \"government of peace\", which need not\\ndisturb the routine course of events. Likewise the \"Rabinic\"\\npolicies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets\\nand the significant increases in the number of persons injured in\\nthe suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.\\n\\nBut the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces\\nitself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has\\nlost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian\\nworkers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel\\nAviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing\\nto propose except separation: Let\\'s cut ourselves off from the\\nPalestinians, let\\'s build a fence so high that they won\\'t be able\\nto harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a\\nfence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.\\n\\nMeron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha\\'aretz (4-3-93): \"...The\\nliberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical\\nseparation and \\'the future of the territories\\', must come to\\nunderstand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab\\nworkers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement\\ndesigned for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that\\ntheir ideological support for separation only provides\\n\\'humanitarian\\' arguments for the legitimization of the <status\\nquo>.\\n\\nEnforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the\\nruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears\\nits burden. [.....].\\n\\n\"Whoover thinks that \\'out of Gaza first\\' is a liberal,\\nhumanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether\\nthis position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off\\nresponsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to\\nthus also disregard responsibility for it\\'s creation. It is very\\neasy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in\\nJerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at\\nthe disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue\\nall their interests, but is barred to the Arabs...\".\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n>From The OTHER Front, Jerusalem, 10 March 1993\\n\\n'),\n",

However,\\n\\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\\n\\n   The Mode of Removal\\n   -------------------\\n\\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\\n\\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\\n\\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\\n   and city quarters.\\n\\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \\nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\\ntheir action as follows:\\n\\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\\n   torture you.\"\\n\\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\\n\\n\\n>>I strongly dispute your notion that Croats had a similar older agenda,\\n>>in fact, for the past century or two, Croats and Muslims have seen\\n>>themselves as having a lot in common, and they generally had friendly\\n>>relations.  Your suggestion that Croat-Muslim relationship is \\n>>anything like Serb-Muslim relationship is completely wrong.\\n>>\\n>>To say that Croats and Muslims have a lot in common does not imply\\n>>they are not separate peoples.  ....\\n>\\n>\\tHow touching.  I have nearly cried while I read this.  Unfortunately,\\n>\\tmostly untrue.\\n\\nWhich part do you claim is untrue?  Explain yourself, or withdraw your claim.\\n\\n>\\tCroats from Croatia mostly had no contacts with Muslims, since they\\n>\\twere mostly \"dealt with extreme preudice\" long time ago. However \\n>\\tone of the main agendas is turning Bosnia into purely Catholic state.\\n\\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \\nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \\n\\n>\\tI should add few more things.  A.J. Evans, in his \"On Foot Through\\n>\\tB&H\" describes that Catholic clergy in the last century was \\n>\\tapparently more scared by Serbs, then by Turks, because Serbs were\\n>\\tgrowing stronger and, unlike Turks, represented great danger for\\n>\\tidea of Catholic Bosnia.  President Tudjman clearly states in \\n>\\this book that Muslims do not exist as a separate nation from \\n>\\tCroats and Serbs, and he many times suggested, even in interviewes to\\n>\\tforeign papers, that solution is to split Bosnia.\\n> \\n>\\tJosip knows this and he is only working on the image of Croatia.\\n\\nIn international relations 101 you\\'ll learn that unless weak unite to\\ncounterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that\\'s the\\nend of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\\nunstable.  I\\'m working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \\nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \\n\\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \\nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \\nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\\nIf not, then all bets are off.\\n\\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I\\'m deeply hurt.\\nThis is not about some \"image\" but about survival of a concept of a\\npartnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats\\nand Muslims.  \\n\\nSigh...\\nJosip\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

How come both Jews and Islam which believe\\non the same God, \"the God of Ebrahim\" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien\\'s story?\\nHow are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them \\nwould distroy the whole world?

What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?\\n\\n\\nMan kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state.\\nA religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society.\\nThe praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes\\nthat God will help him when he prays.\\nReligion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the \\nreligious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to\\nmake their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his\\ncut too! \\n\\nIs in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other\\nhelps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts \\nthat we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will\\nsee the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop\\nanother religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would\\nto come its senses, before it is too late?\\n\\n\\nP.S. on the side\\n\\nDo you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created\\nthe earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God\\nyou have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created\\nGod through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?\\n\\nProfit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught\\nhim about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran?\\nMakeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad\\nwanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? \\n\\nI think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.\\nLook at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will\\nhave the same ending!!!!!!!!\\n\\nReligion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than\\nplotting each others distruction.

There were literally thousands\\n  of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far\\n  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and\\n  the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south\\n  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These\\n  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians\\n  by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian\\n  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of\\n  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian\\n  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting\\n  in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops\\n  and homes.\\n\\n  Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of\\n  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt\\n  and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases\\n  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose\\n  Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the\\n  rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of\\n  instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread\\n  their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where\\n  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes\\n  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled\\n  them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with\\n  little question or opposition.\\n\\n  On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British\\n  High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David\\n  and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:\\n\\n    \\'\\'Sir,\\n\\n      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which\\n      has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which\\n      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,\\n      especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.\\n      Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,\\n      Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison\\n      the people\\'s minds with exaggeration and painted words?

An Armenian legion was organized \\'to expel the Turks from\\n the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted\\n Russian drive into the Bitlis vilayet.\\'[162] Thousands of Armenians from\\n Mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new \\n Armenian state...By mid-July there were as many as 250,000 Armenians\\n crowded into the Van area, which before the crisis had housed and fed\\n no more than 50,000 people, Muslim and non-Muslim alike.[163]\"\\n\\n[162] Hovannisian, \"Road to Independence,\" p. 56; FOP 2488, nos. 127223 and\\n58350.\\n\\n[163] BVA, Meclis-i Vukela Mazbatalari, debates of August 15-17, 1915; \\nBabi-i Ali Evrak Odasi, no. 175, 321, \"Van Ihtilali ve Katl-i Ami,\"\\nZilkade 1333/10 September 1915.\\n\\n\\nSource: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.\\nUniversity of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13.\\n\\n\"The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the\\n area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population\\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\\n of Transcaucasia\\'s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \\n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of \\n Transcaucasia).\\n\\nIn 1920, \\'0\\' percent Turk. \\n\\n\"We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as \\n ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work \\n of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. \\n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \\n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \\n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \\n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \\n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \\n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \\n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \\n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \\n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \\n Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for \\n howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the \\n scattered bones of the dead.\" \\n\\n                             Ohanus Appressian\\n                            \"Men Are Like That\"\\n                                   p. 202.\\n\\n\\n\"An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the\\n systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of \\n the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at \\n least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic.
